      "text": "Using CI CD on Gitlab CE Continuous Integration is a software development practice in which you build and test software every time a developer pushes code to the application, and it happens several times a day. Continuous Delivery is a software engineering approach in which continuous integration, automated testing, and automated deployment capabilities allow software to be developed and deployed rapidly, reliably and repeatedly with minimal human intervention. Still, the deployment to production is defined strategically and triggered manually. Continuous Deployment is a software development practice in which every code change goes through the entire pipeline and is put into production automatically, resulting in many production deployments every day. It does everything that Continuous Delivery does, but the process is fully automated, there s no human intervention at all. The benefits of Continuous Integration are huge when automation plays an integral part of your workflow. GitLab comes with built-in Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment, and Continuous Delivery support to build, test, and deploy your application. Installing Gitlab To install Gitlab, follow the instructions on Installation methods for Gitlab. For Ubuntu, its as simple as adding the repository and installing using apt. You can give an EXTERNAL_URL at the time of installation as the URL at which you want to access your GitLab instance. Installation will automatically configure and start GitLab at that URL. GitLab is configured by setting the relevant options in etc gitlab gitlab.rb. You can use change the external URL by adding or editing the following line in the same file: external_url Run sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure for the change to take effect. GitLab offers a continuous integration service. If you add a .gitlab-ci.yml file to your repository, and configure your GitLab project to use a Runner, then each commit or push, triggers your CI pipeline. Gitlab Docs Installing and Configuring Runners In GitLab, Runners run the jobs that you define in .gitlab-ci.yml. A Runner can be a virtual machine, a VPS, a bare-metal machine, a docker container or even a cluster of containers. GitLab and the Runners communicate through an API, so the only requirement is that the Runner s machine has network access to the GitLab server. Runner can be specific to a certain project or serve multiple projects in GitLab. GitLab Runner implements a number of executors that can be used to run your builds in different scenarios. shell executes build script on host docker executes build inside docker container(s) virtualbox executes build in a virtualbox vm parallels executes build in a parallels vm ssh runs build on a different host via ssh docker-machine autoscales docker machine instances and runs builds in containers across these instances It is recommended that you use docker as the executor as it the cleanest, most common and most feature-rich. In order to have a functional Runner you need to follow two steps: Install it Configure it Once the Runner has been set up, you should see it on the Runners page of your project, following Settings CI CD What is .gitlab-ci.yml The .gitlab-ci.yml file is where you configure what CI does with your project. It lives in the root of your repository. On any push to your repository, GitLab will look for the .gitlab-ci.yml file and start jobs on Runners according to the contents of the file, for that commit. stages: - build - test - deploy build_app: stage: build script: - . make build test_app: stage: test script: - . make test deploy_app: stage: deploy script: - scp . app deployuser: app The .gitlab-ci.yml file defines sets of jobs with constraints of how and when they should be run. The jobs are defined as top-level elements with a name and always have to contain the script keyword. Jobs are used to create jobs, which are then picked by Runners and executed within the environment of the Runner. In the example we define three build stages: build, test and deploy. The order is significant. We also define three jobs, build_app, test_app and deploy_app, which are executed in the order given by the stages to which they belong. If one build stage fails, the others will not be executed. For full documentation of .gitlab-ci.yml, visit Configuration of your jobs with .gitlab-ci.yml Pipeline used in the IRIS Blog At IRIS, we use an internally hosted Gitlab instance for Version Control and Deployment. The CI CD pipeline for the IRIS Blog runs on a locally hosted Gitlab Runner using the Docker executor. image: ruby stages: - build - deploy We use the ruby docker image to run the jobs. The pipeline has two stages build and deploy. All the jobs in the same stage are executed parallelly. Jobs of the next stage (in the order given by stages) are executed only if all the jobs of the previous stage completed running successfully. pages: stage: build script: - gem install jekyll - bundle install - jekyll build -d public artifacts: paths: - public Build stage has one job pages. We first install the dependencies and then build the app using jekyll build in the public folder. If there s any error during the build, it ll show up then and there and the pipeline will come to a halt. So this can also be considered as the testing stage. We have specified the public directory as an artifact which is attached to the job after success. deploy: stage: deploy script: - curl only: - master The deploy stage has one job deploy. When this job is run, a curl request is made at the URL VP_IP and AUTH_TOKEN are Gitlab s secret variables which can be configured in the Variables section in Settings CI CD. This request is made to a server running on the production machine which will deploy the app after authorizing the request. The only parameter specifies that this job will run only when the triggering branch is master . Deployment Server The deployment server is a simple Flask app that is used to run the deployment script to deploy the app. We make a curl request to this server in the deploy job. An alternate to this server is using ssh directly from .gitlab-ci.yml. But this has security risks of exposing the ssh credentials in the script or in the pipeline logs. The production system could be compromised and rendered useless. The server runs a pre-defined script, therefore even if an intruder manages to get authorized, they won t get system access. from flask import Flask, abort import subprocess app Flask(__name__) ( deploy iris_blog string:auth_token ) def deploy_iris_blog(auth_token): if not authenticate(auth_token): return abort(401, Authentication Failed ) ex subprocess.call( cd test IRIS-Blog; git pull , shell True) if ex: return abort(500, Git Error ) ex subprocess.call( bash test IRIS-Blog scripts deploy.sh , shell True) if ex: return abort(500, Deploy Script Error ) return Successfull The request is first authenticated using the auth_token sent along with the request. Then the code base is updated using git pull to update the deploy script which is present in the git repository itself. After this is successful, the deploy script is run that will safely deploy the app. It returns an error if any of the steps fail.",

      "text": "Android Volley - The Ball Game Behind the Scenes A cowboy walks into the bar. He waits for the bartender to come by and orders for a rye whiskey. The bartender returns after a while, hands over the whiskey to the cowboy and moves on to other customers. Same rules apply in the client-server network architecture. It starts with the client sending a HTTP request to the server and the server responding back to the client. Wait, were you expecting a walks-into-a-bar joke? Well, apologies for the disappointment. Let s get down to the brass tacks. Assume that I want to procure the list of all the companies featuring during the placements. I can do so by sending a GET request to the server. The response which I receive from the server contains status information about the request and also the requested content. Now, it is crucial that I craft up the correct query string which I would be sending in the URL of the GET request. Note: A GET request is made to receive response from the server while a POST request is made to send response to server. They are two of the most common HTTP methods; PUT, HEAD, DELETE, PATCH and OPTIONS being others. The server returns the content in JSON format which will be converted behind the scene into a Java object. The JSON data looks something like this: Let s halt for a while and address the elephant in the room. What is it that is enabling me to make the HTTP calls? Android Volley, it is. It is a networking library which was introduced to make networking calls much easier, faster without writing tons of code. Until the release of Volley, the canonical Java class java.net.HttpURLConnection and the Apache org.apache.http.client were the only tools available to Android programmers to develop a RESTful system between a client and a remote backend. Putting aside for a moment the fact that these two classes aren t exempt from bugs, it should be noted how everything that went beyond a simple HTTP transaction had to be written ex novo. If you wanted to cache images or prioritize requests, you had to develop it from scratch. Volley was tailored to cater to these needs. By default all the Volley network calls works asynchronously, so we don t have to worry about using asynctask anymore. Volley comes with lot of features. Some of them are Request queuing and prioritization Effective request cache and memory management Extensibility and customization of the library to our needs Cancelling the requests Volley? Why the name? A client sends a request to a server over the net. It comes back. Metaphor complete xD Coming back to the JSON data we fetched earlier, how do you parse this data into something useful? Volley comes into play, again! Let s put our hands in the dough. So here is the instance of how the JSON data fetched above is parsed into something which can be displayed to the user. public static ArrayList Company companyList; companyList new ArrayList Company (); String url JsonArrayRequest arrayRequest new JsonArrayRequest (Request.Method.GET, url, null, new Response.Listener JSONArray () public void onResponse(JSONArray response) try for (int i 0; i response.length(); i ) JSONObject object jsonArray.getJSONObject(i); String id companies.getString( id ); String name companies.getString( name ); String poc_name companies.getString( poc_name ); String poc_phone companies.getString( poc_phone ); String poc_email companies.getString( poc_email ); String company_type companies.getString( company_type ); String url companies.getString( url ); Company company new Company(id, name, poc_name, poc_phone, poc_email, company_type, url); companyList.add(company); catch (JSONException e) e.printStackTrace(); , new Response.ErrorListener() public void onErrorResponse(VolleyError error) error.printStackTrace(); ); SingletonRequestQueue.getInstance(MainActivity.context).addToRequestQueue(arrayRequest); Beautiful. Isn t it? As you can see, the type of result is already set to JSONArray. As before, the first parameter of the constructor is the HTTP method to use. You then provide the URL to fetch the JSON from. The third variable in the example above is null. This is fine as it indicates that no parameters will be posted along with the request. Finally, you have the listener to receive the JSON response and an error listener. You can pass in null if you want to ignore errors. There is something more it. You might ask, how is the parsed data ultimately displayed on your device screen? Let s take a minor detour to answer this query. Android Application Architecture Let s assume that we want to display these companies as a list in our Android app. For this we will use the ListView provided by Android. However, ListView doesn t actually contain any data themselves. It is just a UI element without data in it. Now, we shall populate this ListView by using an Android adapter. Adapter is an interface whose implementations provide data and control the display of that data. ListView owns adapter that completely control its display. The adapter loads data from the network from the API Server and manufactures views for the ListView upon request. So adapters control the content displayed in the list as well as how to display it. Here is what the adapter file for the code above looks like: class CompanyAdapter extends ArrayAdapter Company public CompanyAdapter(Activity context, ArrayList Company companies) super(context, 0, companies); public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) View listItemView convertView; if(listItemView null) listItemView LayoutInflater.from(getContext()).inflate( R.layout.list_company, parent, false); final Company currentCompany getItem(position); TextView nameView listItemView.findViewById(R.id.company_name); nameView.setText(currentCompany.getName()); return listItemView; How does Volley work under the hood? Volley works on three different levels with each level operating on its own thread. Working of Android Volley Main Thread: On the main thread, one is only allowed to fire the request and handle the response. Cache and Network Threads: When a request is added to the queue, several things happens under the hood. First, Volley checks if the request can be serviced from cache. If it can, the cached response is read, parsed, and delivered. Otherwise it is passed to the network thread.On the network thread, a round-robin with a series of threads is constantly working. The first available network thread dequeues the request, makes the HTTP request, parses the response, and writes it to cache. To finish, it dispatches the parsed response back to the main thread where our listeners are waiting to handle the result. My experiences with Volley I have been using Android Volley for developing the Training and Placement module for IRIS Android app. It comes in quite handy for handling multiple request types, such as string and JSON. In fact, Volley is perfect for API calls such as JSON objects and lists, and it makes working with RESTful applications easy and smooth. Image loading is one of the more useful features of Volley. Just writing a custom ImageLoader and complementing it with the LRU bitmap cache does the work. Google has made considerable efforts to improve the performance of the Volley library by improving memory usage patterns and by passing callbacks to the main thread in a batch. This has relatively reduced context switching and hence makes the app faster. You can check out some Volley tutorials here and here to get yourself started.",
      "original_text": "Android Volley - The Ball Game Behind the Scenes\nA cowboy walks into the bar. He waits for the bartender to come by and orders for a rye whiskey. The bartender returns after a while, hands over the whiskey to the cowboy and moves on to other customers. Same rules apply in the client-server network architecture. It starts with the client sending a HTTP request to the server and the server responding back to the client. Wait, were you expecting a walks-into-a-bar joke? Well, apologies for the disappointment.\nLet’s get down to the brass tacks. Assume that I want to procure the list of all the companies featuring during the placements. I can do so by sending a GET request to the server. The response which I receive from the server contains status information about the request and also the requested content. Now, it is crucial that I craft up the correct query string which I would be sending in the URL of the GET request.\nNote: A GET request is made to receive response from the server while a POST request is made to send response to server. They are two of the most common HTTP methods; PUT, HEAD, DELETE, PATCH and OPTIONS being others.\nThe server returns the content in JSON format which will be converted behind the scene into a Java object. The JSON data looks something like this:\nLet’s halt for a while and address the elephant in the room.\nWhat is it that is enabling me to make the HTTP calls? \nAndroid Volley, it is. It is a networking library which was introduced to make networking calls much easier, faster without writing tons of code.\nUntil the release of Volley, the canonical Java class java.net.HttpURLConnection and the Apache org.apache.http.client were the only tools available to Android programmers to develop a RESTful system between a client and a remote backend. Putting aside for a moment the fact that these two classes aren’t exempt from bugs, it should be noted how everything that went beyond a simple HTTP transaction had to be written ex novo. If you wanted to cache images or prioritize requests, you had to develop it from scratch. Volley was tailored to cater to these needs.\nBy default all the Volley network calls works asynchronously, so we don’t have to worry about using asynctask anymore.\nVolley comes with lot of features. Some of them are\nRequest queuing and prioritization\nEffective request cache and memory management\nExtensibility and customization of the library to our needs\nCancelling the requests\nVolley? Why the name? \nA client sends a request to a server over the net. It comes back. Metaphor complete xD\nComing back to the JSON data we fetched earlier, how do you parse this data into something useful?\nVolley comes into play, again! Let’s put our hands in the dough.

      "text": "Releasing IRIS OAuth for Developers at NITK Announcing the release of IRIS OAuth v1, IRIS is proud to release its OAuth API to all NITK Developers which can be used by Student Clubs, Incident, Engineer and open to collaboration with NITK Startups provided due permission is taken from the respective people. IRIS OAuth provider acts a gateway for Third-party applications websites to authenticate users via IRIS. Kindly check out the given link to know more about it! There are various scopes which need permission from specific people which can directly be found here. Each Scope gives greater access to information on IRIS given a student faculty s consent when they sign up for it. There s a lot of confusion around what exactly OAuth is and whether it s just another thing that is used to login or whether it is a security thing . This article deals with explaining what exactly OAuth is, how it works and addresses the most important question in the GDPR-era whether your data is safe or is it exposed? What is OAuth? In very basic terms, OAuth can t really be categorised as an API or a service, in fact it is an open standard for authorisation and anyone can implement it. Why OAuth? In earlier times, a user would have to enter his her username and password and that particular application would log you in. This gave rise to various problems and for sake of convenience came forward the question, How can I allow an app to access my data without necessarily giving it my password? Facebook uses OAuth very heavily for developers to use information for other developers to use in their applications. If you have ever seen the image below, that is basically OAuth. This permission basically allows the application to access the data on your behalf. Facebook OAuth OAuth as a principle can be thought of as a Hotel Key Card. The Hotel Room can be thought of as the User s Data that you are asking permission to use and the Hotel Front Desk can be thought of the user. If the Hotel Front Desk gives you the Hotel Key Card and approves your use you can use it to access the Hotel Room. Similarly if the User gives the Application to access his data via OAuth, the application can access the User s data. To break it down in a much more simple manner, OAuth basically is: The Application requests authorization from the User to authorize the Application to obtain the User s Data. The User authorizes the Application and submits proof. The Application presents the proof of authorization to server to get a Token. The Token is restricted to only access what the User authorized for the specific Application. Is my data given to IRIS at risk because of this? No, and this is due to the following reasons: The OAuth Service allows the application to access your data only if you authorize it do so. IRIS only acts as a delivery person which delivers your data to the required application You can choose whether you d like to share your data with the required application or not when you are using the OAuth Service. You will be shown exactly what all data is being shared with the service. In case you would not want to share your data, you can choose not to sign up for that application using Sign In with IRIS . How is this useful? The IRIS OAuth Service allows developers to accurately verify the information of a user. Information is provided as per the consent of the user and as per the permission taken by the particular application. To know more about permissions, kindly check out the following link for more information. Who will it benefit? For a long time in NITK, it had been very difficult to verify whether a student is a genuine NITK Student or not whether for Fests or for various administrative purposes. Over the years as IRIS came into the picture, with integration of Academic Modules in IRIS, this problem was significantly reduced. However the student community continued to face this problem, especially young startups operating inside NITK and Student Fests like Incident and Engineer to correctly determine whether a user is a NITKian or not!

      "text": "From Chaos to Control: How IRIS handled Hostel Allotment Every academic year, the hostel and mess allotment process at our institute is one of the most anticipated and crucial tasks. Traditionally, this process was conducted offline, requiring students to visit the Hostel Office in person to secure their accommodation. This meant long lines, crowded offices, and students needing to arrive on campus earlier, often causing significant inconvenience and stress to both the students and the authorities involved. Recognizing these challenges, we transitioned to an online, first-come, first-served allotment process through the IRIS platform. For the past few years, we have conducted the hostel allotment online. However, these attempts faced numerous new challenges and hassles, which we navigated with a lot of struggle and support from the Council of Wardens and the Hostel Office. There were system issues, crashes and delays in starting the process, causing frustration among students. Given the stakes involved -students eager to secure their preferred rooms and messes, ensuring a smooth and efficient allotment process was our top priority. The IRIS platform had to handle thousands of simultaneous requests as students rushed to book their hostel rooms. This surge in traffic posed a substantial challenge, requiring our systems to perform under high load conditions. Our team anticipated this and took extensive measures to prepare for this situation, ensuring that our servers could manage the peak load without any hiccups. The meticulous planning and robust system setup allowed us to navigate the high-demand period smoothly, providing a seamless experience for all users involved. A Basic Overview of our setup We use multiple load balancers both internally and externally to manage and direct the load and prevent any single point of failure. Our application is built on Ruby on Rails, a versatile web application framework, and we utilize MariaDB, an open source relational database, to store the data. It is currently a single master system, where all the write operations are handled by the primary database server. Our services are hosted on a locally maintained Nutanix cluster which provides a robust infrastructure capable of supporting our current needs. Here s a behind-the-scenes look at how we prepared for and executed this essential process using our existing infrastructure: Rigorous Load Testing for Seamless Performance What is load testing? Load testing is the process of testing applications by simulating and monitoring an estimated system load. It is an effective way to find bottlenecks or any shortcomings that could be present in the system or the application. As with every application, IRIS has faced some encountered performance issues under heavy load in previous years. To prevent these problems and ensure a seamless operation this time, we took a thorough load testing procedure to ensure a smooth operation in high load conditions. Over a few weeks, we rigorously tested the hostel allotment endpoints for the same. This enabled us to serve our end users with a reliable application that would behave as expected at any moment. Implementation To conduct the load testing, we leveraged k6 from Grafana Labs Here s a brief overview of our setup and tools: k6: Our primary load testing tool. Prometheus and InfluxDB: These were used to bring up data and logs from the k6 containers to the Grafana dashboard. Node-Exporter: Utilized to monitor the vitals of the load generator, ensuring no bottlenecks from the load generator, especially on the network front. Flow diagram of our setup Why k6? We had chosen k6 as our load testing tool for several important reasons. K6 allowed us to get started with our load testing process quickly. Thus, we could focus on the main test logic rather than worrying about how the tool must be set up. K6 also had out-of-the-box support for stages and parallel connections, which we had utilized extensively throughout our testing process. Moreover, k6 scripts are written in JavaScript, which is widely used, making it easier to work with. A brief overview of the test Our scripts were mainly focused on only the hostel allotment s endpoints. We had a number of test users set up for the sole purpose of testing. We also created a test hostel whose rooms we used to test the user load. Docker containers were set up for ease of replication of the tests. We also had some scripts for frontend tests that would estimate the load not only on the allotment endpoints but also on the endpoints from where the assets would be served. The scripts would choose a random user and a random room from the list of users and rooms that we had created and then try allocating the user to the hostel that we created for testing. The script authenticates the user and then uses the user s specific credentials to further access the hostel allotments endpoint, and then a request is made to allot the user into the hostel room. We also simulated retries to make it as close to real life as possible. Grafana Dashboard Here s a quick summary of a few stats from one of our earlier tests: The Grafana Dashboard template that we have, shows us some vital information like virtual users, rate of requests, errors and checks. From the tests above, you can see that in this particular test, at this point, we had simulated over 1.36k users. All of these users connect to our application in parallel. We had some checks set in place for ensuring that if a user has logged in and if the user has been allotted. This provides us with some insights of the HTTP requests that were sent during the tests. The graphs show us the min, max and p90 HTTPS requests duration among others over the duration of the test. We measured all traffic in the application, resource utilization and throughput rates to identify the application s breaking point and any other overlooked shortcomings. We were comfortably able to handle over 2.5k users accessing our application simultaneously. Every single error, crash or slow down during the testing was observed and investigated in depth. We made necessary adjustments to the configurations of the application and the services it depended on, to ensure that there were no more bottlenecks and the application performs exactly as expected at any point of time. We also ran frontend tests for the hostel allotments and addressed issues with asset fetching during these tests. Although they weren t as successful as the backend tests we conducted, they now serve as a good foundation for us to develop further and improve our frontend testing. With further development in frontend testing, we would be able to test our application on much closer real-life situations. Future Enhancements and Testing Strategies Going forward, we may implement testing for all major modules and maybe even integrate some basic tests in the CI CD pipeline of the modules we work on. This would help us mitigate all those issues bugs that may have been overlooked during the development process, guaranteeing a smooth experience for our end users. Strategic Slot-Based Allotment for Efficient Management The results of the load testing helped us understand the theoretical maximum load our system could handle. We realized that handling allotments for 5000 students together might not be the best of approaches. Therefore to handle this and manage better we devised a slot-based system where different batches would have staggered start times. This was crucial because the initial surge when the allotment opened caused the highest load on our servers. By having different start times, we ensured that no single moment would overwhelm the system. We worked closely with the Council of Wardens to determine the best slots according to their plan, ensuring fairness and efficiency. Each batch had specific rooms reserved for their slot, so no one s chances of securing a preferred room were compromised by the staggered timings. This collaborative planning ensured a balanced distribution of the load and a smooth allotment process for everyone involved. Addressing Issues in Real Time and Contingency Plan While we had meticulously prepared for a smooth process, unforeseen issues can arise. To manage such scenarios, we had implemented a robust contingency plan and were monitoring actively. In the unlikely event of significant problems during the allotment process, our primary contingency measure was to remove the IRIS record from the Load Balancer (LB) and restore the database from the most recent backup taken just before the allotment began. This strategy would allow us to quickly mitigate disruptions and resume other normal operations with minimal delay. Following the restoration, we could immediately engage in debugging both the application and database to identify and resolve any issues or queries causing blockages. Throughout the allotment process, our team closely monitored the system where we utilized Sentry, which provided real-time server error tracking and Nutanix to monitor our Virtual machines real time statistics, to ensure prompt identification and resolution of any unforeseen problems, thereby maintaining the integrity of the process. Controller Wise Hits We had over 2.38 lakh hits on the hostels controllers itself over the duration of the allotments. Real-time stats from our application virtual machines during the hostel allotments Here s a brief of the stats: CPU and Memory: The peak load on the processor was 95 while the memory usage of the server never went above 72.5 . Controller IOPS: Shows us the number of input output operations, i.e, read or write operations, that happen per second. We clocked a peak of 69 IOPS. Controller Avg IO Latency: We had a peak average latency of about 18ms, which represents the time from when a IO request is made and a response is received for the same. CPU Ready Time: It represents the amount of time spent by a VM waiting for the hypervisor to schedule a physical process when it is ready to process a task. It is either shown in milliseconds or as a percentage. The CPU ready percentage is the percentage of time the CPU spends waiting relative to the time it is run. A lower CPU ready percentage is beneficial for an application. We had a peak CPU Ready percentage of 0.72 which means our processors spent very little time waiting. The peaks correspond to the moment when the hostel allotments were enabled, as we saw a huge influx of users at once. As evident from the stats, there were no abnormalities during the allotment period, and everything remained under control. Conclusion The successful execution of this year s hostel allotment process was a testament to our meticulous planning and the collaborative effort of all involved. The testing of the application beforehand helped us fix the issues that may have gone unfound or, worse, would have been found only when the application was subjected to such high loads. This proactive approach enabled us to handle high traffic efficiently, ensuring a smooth experience for all. We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to Dr. Pushparaj Shetty D (Prof-in-charge, Hostels), Hostel Office, all the Hostel Block Wardens, and Quality and Maintenance Wardens for their invaluable support and guidance throughout this process. Their cooperation in sharing the allotment plans on time, timely communication for any changes, and most importantly, putting faith in us -a student-led team, to carry out this task were crucial to our success. Special thanks to our dedicated team members K Vinit Puranik, Devaansh Kumar, Utkarsh Mahajan and our alumnus mentor Sushanth Sathesh Rao for their exceptional efforts in conducting rigorous load testing and ensuring the platform s readiness, and Vedant Tarale, Fahim Ahmed and Dhruva N for their crucial roles in communicating requirements, setting up the module configurations, monitoring, and managing issues throughout the process. We look forward to continued improvements and innovations at IRIS, always striving to enhance the experience for everyone involved.",

      "text": "Efabless - IRIS Labs Hardware Team s Journey What is Efabless? As quoted on the website, Efabless is a free cloud-based chip design platform, growing community of 1000 chip designers, and fabrication friendly technology company that takes you from idea to silicon inside your product . Efabless not only facilitates opportunities to develop low-cost design but has indeed been known for promoting open-source practices in chip design, including providing an open-source design flow. The concept of an open-source design flow refers to making the entire process of designing a semiconductor chip accessible and transparent to the community. Make your custom chip for free! Anyone can design and fabricate their open-source design for free with the Open MPW (Multi-Project Wafer) Program. The shuttle program lets designers try out new ideas without worrying about the cost of making them. It s open to everyone, as long as their project is fully open source and meets certain requirements. Google covers the costs of making, packaging, evaluating, and shipping the projects in this program. Fig 1. MPW Shuttle Through this blog, we will cover the comprehensive process of IC Design flow using Open-source tools, exploring each stage from conception to fabrication We will initially pace through some VLSI jargon at the beginning. It ll all click into place when we delve into the intricacies later on. So, buckle up What is a PDK? A Process Design Kit (PDK) is a comprehensive set of files, data, and tools provided by semiconductor foundries to assist chip designers in developing integrated circuits compatible with a specific manufacturing process. It encompasses technology files, design rules, device models, standard cell libraries, and simulation tools crucial for designing and verifying semiconductor components. While many PDKs are proprietary and specific to certain foundries, some open-source PDKs are freely available to the public. Notable examples include SkyWater PDK, associated with the SkyWater Technology Foundry, and GF180MCU, an open-source PDK that is a collaboration between Google and GlobalFoundries. GDSII GDSII stream format (GDSII) is a binary database file format which is the de facto industry standard for data exchange of integrated circuit or IC layout artwork. It is a binary file format representing planar geometric shapes, text labels, and other information about the layout in hierarchical form. With the help of this file, the photomask is designed using a process called lithography. As shown in Figure 2 is a rendering of a small GDSII standard cell with three metal layers.GDSII files were originally written on magnetic tape. The final deadline for IC designers is still called tape-out for this reason! Fig 2. GDSII Standard Cell (Source) Fig 3. Example of GDSII layout viewed in Klayout Source: Caravel Efabless OpenLane Fig 4. The OpenLane Flow (Source) OpenLane is an open-source tool designed for implementing Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). OpenLane is a no-human-in-the-loop RTL to GDS compiler built around OpenROAD that works like a GNU software compiler with trade-offs in area and performance. It simplifies the whole design flow from the high-level hardware description of the RTL Design to the Physical Design of the integrated circuit. How does it work? OpenLane operates on a straightforward yet efficient method based on modular Steps that can be combined to form Flows. Each Step has defined inputs and outputs, enabling the creation of highly complex chip layouts through their sequential chaining. Below are the steps in OpenLane flow. Synthesis: The synthesis step converts a behavioural description of the design into an equivalent gate-level netlist. It then maps the functionality present in RTL code to the library of standard cells such as NAND, NOR... gates specific to the target technology node. Static Timing Analysis: It checks the design for any timing violations ensuring that signals meet specified timing constraints and allowing designers to identify and address potential timing issues for optimal performance. Floorplanning: This step involves arranging and optimizing the placement of digital components on a chip, determining their relative positions and sizes to meet design goals and constraints. Before placement, it is essential to determine the macro placement and blockages to ensure a compliant GDS file. Placement: This step initially starts with a coarse placement of standard cells in roughly the right places, called global placement. The next step aligns the cells to the grid and ensures they don t overlap while trying to reduce or limit the wiring length, which is a finer placement. Routing: This step involves creating pathways for interconnections between standard cells on a chip, optimizing for signal integrity, and meeting design constraints. Clock Tree Synthesis: This step generates a hierarchical tree structure for distributing clock signals, optimizing for low skew (variation in signal arrival time) and power consumption. Design Rule Check: DRC (Design Rule Checking) verifies that the layout of an integrated circuit complies with predetermined manufacturing rules, ensuring error-free physical design. It is a pivotal step to identify and correct potential violations that could affect the functionality and reliability of the final chip. Caravel Caravel is a template SoC (System-on-Chip) for Efabless Open MPW (Multi Project Wafer) and chipIgnite shuttles based on the OpenPDK Sky130 node and GF180MCU node. Fig 4.

Integrating the custom RTL design with the Caravel Template RTL Code Integration Clone the Caravel template from GitHub, obtaining user_project_wrapper and user_proj_example. User-defined modules are instantiated in user_project_wrapper to manage port interactions. Set up essential variables and integrate the user module s RTL files into user_proj_example.v You need to modify the configs file in OpenLane based on your custom design specifications. Run the OpenLane flow to harden the macro. Refer to this for a more detailed explanation Here is a cool video by Samsung explaining how an IC fab works Verification of the Design (testbench, Cocotb) There are two ways we can verify the design. The first method involves writing a Verilog-based testbench and simulating the complete design. This process aims to validate functional verification by analyzing the produced waveforms. The second method utilises the Python-based testbench cocotb (coroutine-based co-simulation testbench) to verify the functional correctness of the design. It supports VHDL and SystemVerilog RTL and is known for its simplicity and versatility in the testbench environment. Running MPW Precheck Locally Efabless shuttle has various requirements to be met for the submission and ensure that the design meets the specified criteria and standards before being included in a multi-project wafer run. This precheck process helps identify and rectify any issues or discrepancies in the design, ensuring that it aligns with the requirements of the fabrication process. How to submit to Efabless? Firstly, we need to ensure that all our codes are made public on GitHub. We need to login into the efabless website, select the shuttle, and then click on the Start Project button. Fill in the necessary details and an empty efabless repository will be created automatically. We need to push our files to this repository and it can only be done through SSH linked to our profile. We can make use of git LFS (large file storage) to store the larger files that get generated during OpenLane flow. Create an SSH key and add it to your profile on the efabless website. Copy the SSH link of the empty efabless repository and add it as the remote in your local git repository. SSH git-lfs to track all the large files that we want to push. Use the added remote to push the files to the efabless repository. Congratulations! You have successfully submitted to the efabless.

      "original_text": "Efabless - IRIS Labs Hardware Team's Journey\nWhat is Efabless? \nAs quoted on the website,\n“Efabless is a free cloud-based chip design platform, growing community of 1000+ chip designers, and fabrication friendly technology company that takes you from idea to silicon inside your product”.\nEfabless not only facilitates opportunities to develop low-cost design but has indeed been known for promoting open-source practices in chip design, including providing an open-source design flow. The concept of an open-source design flow refers to making the entire process of designing a semiconductor chip accessible and transparent to the community.\nMake your custom chip for free! \nAnyone can design and fabricate their open-source design for free with the Open MPW (Multi-Project Wafer) Program. The shuttle program lets designers try out new ideas without worrying about the cost of making them. It’s open to everyone, as long as their project is fully open source and meets certain requirements. Google covers the costs of making, packaging, evaluating, and shipping the projects in this program.\nFig 1. MPW Shuttle\nThrough this blog, we will cover the comprehensive process of IC Design flow using Open-source tools, exploring each stage from conception to fabrication\nWe will initially pace through some VLSI jargon at the beginning. It’ll all click into place when we delve into the intricacies later on. So, buckle up 🙂\nWhat is a PDK? \nA Process Design Kit (PDK) is a comprehensive set of files, data, and tools provided by semiconductor foundries to assist chip designers in developing integrated circuits compatible with a specific manufacturing process. It encompasses technology files, design rules, device models, standard cell libraries, and simulation tools crucial for designing and verifying semiconductor components. While many PDKs are proprietary and specific to certain foundries, some open-source PDKs are freely available to the public. Notable examples include SkyWater PDK, associated with the SkyWater Technology Foundry, and GF180MCU, an open-source PDK that is a collaboration between Google and GlobalFoundries.\nGDSII \nGDSII stream format (GDSII) is a binary database file format which is the de facto industry standard for data exchange of integrated circuit or IC layout artwork. It is a binary file format representing planar geometric shapes, text labels, and other information about the layout in hierarchical form. With the help of this file, the photomask is designed using a process called lithography. As shown in Figure 2 is a rendering of a small GDSII standard cell with three metal layers.GDSII files were originally written on magnetic tape. The final deadline for IC designers is still called tape-out for this reason!\nFig 2. GDSII Standard Cell (Source)\nFig 3. Example of GDSII layout viewed in Klayout\nSource: Caravel Efabless\nOpenLane \nFig 4. The OpenLane Flow (Source)\nOpenLane is an open-source tool designed for implementing Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). OpenLane is a no-human-in-the-loop RTL to GDS compiler built around OpenROAD that works like a GNU software compiler with trade-offs in area and performance. It simplifies the whole design flow from the high-level hardware description of the RTL Design to the Physical Design of the integrated circuit.\nHow does it work? \nOpenLane operates on a straightforward yet efficient method based on modular “Steps” that can be combined to form “Flows.” Each Step has defined inputs and outputs, enabling the creation of highly complex chip layouts through their sequential chaining. Below are the steps in OpenLane flow.\nSynthesis: The synthesis step converts a behavioural description of the design into an equivalent gate-level netlist. It then maps the functionality present in RTL code to the library of standard cells such as NAND, NOR… gates specific to the target technology node.\nStatic Timing Analysis: It checks the design for any timing violations ensuring that signals meet specified timing constraints and allowing designers to identify and address potential timing issues for optimal performance.\nFloorplanning: This step involves arranging and optimizing the placement of digital components on a chip, determining their relative positions and sizes to meet design goals and constraints. Before placement, it is essential to determine the macro placement and blockages to ensure a compliant GDS file.\nPlacement: This step initially starts with a coarse placement of standard cells in roughly the right places, called global placement. The next step aligns the cells to the grid and ensures they don’t overlap while trying to reduce or limit the wiring length, which is a finer placement.\nRouting: This step involves creating pathways for interconnections between standard cells on a chip, optimizing for signal integrity, and meeting design constraints.\nClock Tree Synthesis: This step generates a hierarchical tree structure for distributing clock signals, optimizing for low skew (variation in signal arrival time) and power consumption.\nDesign Rule Check: DRC (Design Rule Checking) verifies that the layout of an integrated circuit complies with predetermined manufacturing rules, ensuring error-free physical design. It is a pivotal step to identify and correct potential violations that could affect the functionality and reliability of the final chip.\nCaravel \nCaravel is a template SoC (System-on-Chip) for Efabless Open MPW (Multi Project Wafer) and chipIgnite shuttles based on the OpenPDK Sky130 node and GF180MCU node.\nFig 4.

      "text": "Puptime - Bring Your Own Hooks Need for Puptime IRIS has over twenty-five network services, from services like SMTP and DNS name servers in addition to the expected HTTP servers and databases. Ensuring all services work and are always available (that is, have a high uptime) can be tricky. A system uptime monitoring tool automates monitoring services and notifies the IRIS team immediately to take corrective action when a service fails. While there are many server uptime monitoring tools available, ranging from open-source, free, and enterprise-grade none of the available tools satisfied our requirements. In particular, we were looking for flexibility in integration (for example, recording failures in a database for analytics and posting status updates to a secondary website) and more precision with application protocols (identifying whether Redis is working rather than a UDP server). Thus, IRIS-Team created Puptime (stylistically P Uptime) to solve our unique problems and needs. It is one of our first open-source projects and is participating in NITK Winter of Code (2020). Current Architecture Puptime (and all other uptime monitors) have two primary functions: Querying the state of network services and publishing notifications. Let s take a closer look at each of them. Querying the state of network service means to check whether the service is working and accessible. For an HTTP server, this might include checking whether the host is reachable (the host is active, part of the network and not blocked by a firewall), the port is reachable (a process is listening), and the contents of the page are what we expect, typically done by looking for specific phrases in response. We ask for known domain s IP addresses and compare the results for a DNS server. Querying network services is dependent on the application protocol. The functionality is implemented by Puptime::Service::HTTP, Puptime::Service::DNS, and other application-specific classes, which inherit common behavior from Puptime::Service::Base. When a network service fails, Puptime publishes notifications by notifying on communication channels. Currently, Puptime can send e-mails and send messages on Microsoft Teams although the exact nature of the channel is unimportant. For organizations that use Slack for internal communication, Puptime should ideally be extended to notify on Slack (we look at problems with extending Puptime later on). Similar to services, the functionality resides in Puptime::Notifier::Email and Puptime::Notifier::Team with common behavior in Puptime::Notifier::Base. The services and communication channels are connected through Puptime::ServiceSet and Puptime::NotificationQueue. Puptime::ServiceSet is the set of network services queried, with each query running in a new thread. If a service fails, the failure and any diagnostic information are pushed toPuptime::NotificationQueue and consumed by the communication channels. Downsides of Current Architecture While the current architecture works and Puptime is used successfully in production, I cannot help but feel uneasy. The Unix Philosophy summarizes my unease with remarkable accuracy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface. Doug McIlroy, the inventor of Unix pipes and one of the founders of the Unix tradition. It s hard to argue that Puptime does one thing, especially with the increasing number of integrations. Currently, it is supposed to: Query network systems about their status. Save query results into a log file. Save query results into a database. Send notification through Microsoft Teams. Send notification through E-mail. We are also looking to add a web server to query whether Puptime is up (infinite recursion, anyone?), integrate with version control to publish status updates to a secondary website, similar to istheservicedown, and other unforeseen integrations. The point being, Puptime wears many hats. Puptime is also a black box to other applications. Puptime takes no inputs (except a configuration file) and has no output again, except log files meant for human consumption. The inability to work with other applications makes it difficult to solve ad-hoc problems with Puptime. Extending Puptime to send notifications on Slack would require code changes upstream while being functionally the same as Microsoft Teams and E-mail. One might implement all requested integrations to compensate but it requires substantial developer investment, increases source code (making the application slower and larger), and forces unrequired dependencies. Alternative Architecture As discussed in the previous section, Puptime does many things and does not work with other programs. Life is easier when we dump our problems on others. Anthony Williams, Author of C Concurrency in Action discusses how using std::async dumps thread management onto the C standard library. If Puptime queries network systems and calls appropriate hooks, we have pulled off an impressive magic trick in shrinking responsibilities. We dump the problem of writing integrations onto the users (who know their systems better than us). Suddenly, all sorts of integrations seem possible after all, it s only the matter of writing an appropriate hook. Let s walk through the new cycle of events: Puptime starts and parses configuration. For each service in configuration, Puptime queries the service and writes the result to a temporary file. Depending on the service status, Puptime calls the appropriate hooks (if any), passing the temporary file and moves on next service. I like to call the alternative architecture an event-driven architecture as focus shifts from a linear procedure to calling hooks when a relevant event occurs. It s easy to see that logging was a specific hook called after each query and sending notifications were a specific hook called after each failing status. Integrating new services is a breeze now. For example, integrating Slack no longer requires implementing Puptime::Notifier::Slack but only parsing a JSON file and making use of Slack API. By shifting responsibilities, Puptime can focus on its niche targeting more application protocols with specificity that other uptime monitors do not. The alternative architecture is not without faults. There is some overhead with writing to and reading from files, compared to shared memory access. Executing external files without sandboxing can lead to security vulnerabilities (mainly if Puptime is run as root). Puptime needs to ensure backward compatibility should the target file format change. But in my opinion, the positives outweigh the negatives. Conclusion Puptime is a tool that grew out of IRIS s needs that existing uptime services did not satisfy greater specificity with application protocols, automatic triggers to integrate with our workflow, and low resource consumption. It s out of the initial prototyping phase and we are looking to add features fast. We are happy to open source it and look forward to contributions on making the alternative design a reality and more!",

And though you sometimes try different search strings to refine the results, nobody trained you to do that. On Amazon you can find, order and have delivered to your door virtually anything you want, with a few clicks of your mouse. And on Facebook, you easily post pictures and connect with friends around the world...from any device, anytime and from anywhere. What is common to these applications is that the complexity of the application has been moved to the backend so the UI is simple and intuitive. Which is the number one rule of good UI design. This winter, I had interned with IRIS as I was interested in UI-UX development and there was post available in IRIS. The prerequisites for the post included HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery, Ruby On Rails (which was optional). The Interview After registering for the post, I was called for an interview, during which I had to list my frontend related work and projects that I had previously done. I had explained why I was interested to work with their team and for the respective project followed by certain questions about how confident I was about my skills. Working on the technites 2K18 website had given me a bit of an edge. On the same day, I got a message informing me that I was selected as an intern for UI-UX team in IRIS and I was given the UI-UX analysis of the placement Module. I worked on both UX analysis and UI designing parallelly. UX Analysis: The first half of my work included an analysis of the 75 feedbacks which were given by different users like SPoCs , ICs , PCs , students and Faculties which were already collected. I had to classify my findings into 3 categories MUST, SHOULD and COULD, and document it. I used google docs for the same and discussed whether my findings were implementable or not with the team. For the second half, I worked on the recruitment schedule page where I had to contact the users of it, collect their feedbacks and again classify them considering each and every user in mind, and then discuss with the team whether the feature which the user requested is possible to implement or not, if yes, then what are the possible ways to do it followed by documentation. During the first half, I made small changes like adding instructions button and toggle effect on switchery buttons in the placement module. In the second half, I made changes on the recruitment schedule page based on the UX analysis. I rearranged the contents of that page based on the logical flow, where first I created a pen and paper prototype for designing the page and then went for the actual implementation. I added another column to an existing table which showed the number of unplaced students applied for that particular company. And displayed information about the period of bond for placements. Pen and paper prototype Recruitment Schedule page And then added another modal page which shows the number of unplaced students in each range of CGPA for all the branches and specializations which the company is open to. Throughout the course of this internship, I have gained a better understanding of how a website such as IRIS works on the whole. I learned how to integrate the front-end and back-end of a website and how to work with MySQL and Ruby on Rails. In addition to these software skills, I learned to work in collaboration with a team. And most importantly, learned that to be a good UI-UX developer, in addition to learning programming languages, you need to be technically sound in all other aspects related to the design and functionality of various websites. I am thankful for the chance of being under the guidance of my mentors who made sure I was on the right track throughout the process, provided useful and appropriate resources to refer to and made sure I was comfortable throughout the Winter Internship. This was overall a very beneficial and fun experience for me.",

      "text": "IRIS Annual Report 2022-23 - IRIS Blog True to the saying Change is the Only Constant , the past year for IRIS has been characterized by the commencement of new projects, various new feature introductions, and numerous modifications to all the products and services of the IRIS Team. As the year comes to a close, the time is ripe to reflect upon the significant accomplishments and extend our gratitude to all our stakeholders. As NITK switched to its first full academic year in offline mode post the COVID-19 lockdown, the hostel room and mess allotment process to take place at the hostel office for approximately 6000 students was something that the entire NITK community wanted to avoid. The long cruel queues became a thing of the past in just a few weeks as the IRIS Team digitized the entire process completely. After innumerable iterations, the hostel module has taken a steady shape, to say the least. In view of the grave challenges faced during the entire journey, we would like to thank the Hostel Office, Students Council, Hostel Council, Taskforce, the students, and their parents for all their understanding and support. The IRIS mobile app witnessed unprecedented growth with around 3000 new downloads. The most significant achievement has been the introduction of the iOS app thereby ensuring accessibility and convenience for all. The aim was to improve the student experience at NITK which has been accomplished through the introduction of various new modules such as the mess menu, freshers cup, etc. Apart from the IRIS app and website, the team also undertook various other projects. In collaboration with the Centre for System Design (CSD), the team developed a working prototype of a mobile app to provide software support for Urja, NITK s solar-powered charging station for e-mobility. The website of the Career Development Centre (CDC) was completely developed by the IRIS Team and inaugurated at the start of the placement season. As always, the team members found immense satisfaction in engaging with the student community. A total of 5 students were recruited to intern with the web and app development teams as part of the Code-In 107 internship program. A Product Bootcamp was introduced by the Product Team as part of the recruitment process while the traditional tracks of Ruby on Rails and Flutter witnessed active participation. The Intro to Systems workshop conducted by the Systems team was also well received. The credit goes to the team of developers, product managers, and the various team leads for their exceptional expertise, dedication, and commitment. We appreciate Dr. Sathyabodh M Kulkarni (Chairman, Management Information System (MIS)), Dr. Basavaraj Talawar (Faculty-in-Charge MIS Office), Dr. Gangadharan KV (Coordinator, CSD), and Dr. Manjunatha Sharma (Associate Dean Academic, UG) for their instrumental contribution towards incentivizing the team with a credits system through the recent modifications to the academic curriculum. A special thanks to Dr. Mohit P Tahiliani (IRIS Faculty Advisor) for his continuous guidance. We also recognize and acknowledge the involvement of all our stakeholders the Director, Deans, Registrar, Assistant Registrars, CDC, Central Computer Centre, the MIS Officers, and all the faculties and students of NITK. We shall remain indebted to our seniors and alumni mentors for their valuable mentorship. We also extend our heartfelt thanks to Mr. Salman Shah (Tech Lead 2018-19) for sharing his IRIS experience with the team, providing perspective, and motivating the team during his visit to the NITK campus. Looking ahead, there is a huge potential for further growth and the future looks very bright and optimistic to reach greater heights.

      "text": "Enriching User. Enriching Experience - IRIS Blog This humble blog post, deals with an aspect of IRIS, that was relatively sidelined when the team had to focus on developing the more critical components of the Student Lifecycle Management System. User Experience is an aspect that can make the difference between your product skyrock its prospects over night and it failing to connect with the intended consumer base. Let me elaborate with history. Why do we Google everything? Why did we not end up Bing ing or Yahoo ing it? Take a look at the Google s search page. Where did it all start for the tech giant. A Google logo and a search bar and a lot of blank space. Typically. The other search giants in question looked at this differently. We have all this whitespace, why not let the user have some more valuable information presented? Why not let the user know what s happening around him her the world? Why not display some photos and videos in that otherwise empty space? They failed. Google boomed. The answer is User Experience. Google was the first to figure out that, when a user wants to search for something, that really is all they want to do. Search. We see this in our everyday life on the internet. We judge a website by its look and feel. We even decide it s authenticity based on these aspects alone. If it FEELS right, enough effort and thought has gone into it. WhatsApp wasn t the first messaging app of it s kind. Tez wasn t the first payment platform. Heck, even Facebook wasn t half as popular as Orkut in India. The answer? User Experience (UX) Development is the procedure of improving the overall experience of the users when they interact with the application or website in order to achieve its objective to provide the maximum user satisfaction. It keeps customers in mind and creates the basic skeleton of any application. The User Interface (UI), on the other hand focuses on the application s look and feel as to how it interacts with the users. Being in UX is about user research and solving the actual problems that people have not just the ones the business or product team thinks they have. The following is not a tutorial. Not a walk through. It s not very technical either. It is the process that I followed as a UI UX Designer, to make IRIS a more usable platform than it already is. Here, in particular, the very vital IRIS Placement module. Take a look at this illustration, that shows a typical UX design flow. UX Flowchart 1. The Strategy. This is where a UX designer analyzes his market, understands the crowd. The stakeholders of the system in question is identified and plotted in the Stakeholder Map. Knowing the nature of the different stakeholder groups, and how they are inter related, and how they will be using the module is vital to formulating a User Research Plan, that elaborates on what strategies and techniques will be followed. An important part of this phase is to prepare a questionnaire specific to each stakeholder. This is crucial to consistently maintaining professionalism in conversations, in order to invariably result in crucial substance for the research at hand. Take a look at the User Research Plan and note the Stakeholder Map within. User Research Plan The User Research Plan and Stakeholder Questionnaire PDF 2. The Discovery. I presume you might have recently taken a mental note of IRIS s sudden development of interest in what you think of the platform, courtesy the suggestion forms that were spammed. That was discovery. Or at least one part of it. The stakeholders were defined and the plan of action forumulated. In this phase, the methods specified in the User Research Plan was put into practise. Discovery Insight in short, 2.1 Students. There were 44 respondents for the placement module google form circulated primarily for the Batch of 2019, IRIS Placement module s sole user base so far. Google Form Link to the form: (still active) 2.2 PCs ICs. A hangouts call session was organized with the head PC and a former IC who is a PC this year, Adithya Kamath and Manali Shah respectively, where the structure and flow of the Placement module was elaborated to the coordinators, during which they were asked to point out the changes in interface and experience they deem required and other suggestions they d like to see incorporated in the final module. Responses were also also collected from a number of other PCs either by directly contacting them or through their submissions in the form circulated. 2.3 Others. The other stakeholders were contacted largely via e-mail and asked to browse through the module and put in their valuable feedback. 2.4 User Research Outcome Document. User Research Outcome 3. The Analysis. At the end of the research phase, I was left with a Google Sheet complete with numerous ideas and suggestions, that largely did not agree with each other. Some responses opined that the current UI was impeccable, while some others complained on aspects of navigation and space utilization. Several responses commented on the User Experience aspects instead, such as the suggestions highlighting the need for an efficient notification system and avoiding the confusion that seems to exist with deadlines and company visiting status. One by one, I went through each respondent s complete list of suggestions and answers in the questionnaire, tried to gain an insight into what might have caused this suggestion to arise, and to understand where in the module this problem lies, or the aspect for which the said suggestion will make a difference. This identified cause aspect, was added to the list of NEEDs . Need an indication of eligibility to apply Need more awareness about features components Need to know more about the job while applying Need IRIS to be more mobile friendly Need a simpler navigation Need the companies to be listed based on branch Need to avoid confusion regarding deadlines dates process The recommendations and suggestions offered to tackle these needs, were noted down, to be used in a later stage. But at this point, the priority is the cause, not the solution. Gathering all the insight from the 50 odd stakeholders that I had some sort of correspondence with, I was able to consolidate the crux of research, in the form of 7 needs, that covers the necessity of every suggestion that was made. These seven needs were classified using the MoSCoW Method. Queer name, is it not? Alas, it has nothing to do with the Russian capital. The method of classifying the needs and their corresponding solutions into an order of priority for implementation. The Must Should Could Would Method. M Must have this requirement to meet the business needs S Should have this requirement if possible, but project success does not rely on it C Could have this requirement if it does not affect anything else on the project W Would like to have this requirement later, but delivery won t be this time For the purposes of IRIS however, the Coulds and Woulds were practically the same, and were merged into Could. Research Insights Document 4. The Design. Now that the needs were defined, understood and classified, the design phase exorts us to explore these said needs, form our unbiased opinions of them and to exercise utmost liberty in listing out every solution imaginable. 4.1 How Might We. In that spirit, the first step was taken in a popular UX method known as HOW MIGHT WE. This method is least concerned with feasibility or practicality or even necessity. How might We (HMW) questions are short questions that launch brainstorms. They act as seeds for ideation. Given a need, it is simply about analyzing it s every end, and in twisting it s every word, and in forming How Might We questions out of these. How Might We The frameworking for doing a How Might We thinking session is below, along with what I thought up for the below need. Need more awareness about features components Amp up the good: HMW increase awareness on features? HMW impart instructions on usage? Explore the opposite: HMW make IRIS usable without instructions? Question an assumption: HMW entirely remove the need for instructions? Go after adjectives: HMW make the instructions interesting and un-boring? ID unexpected resources: HMW use the NITK website, Facebook page, Whatsapp groups to create awareness Create an analogy from need or context: HMW make IRIS like a social media platform or a job portal like Internshala. Play POV against the challenge: HMW make IRIS what users want to use so that they are always familiar with it? Change a status quo: HMW make the users more intelligent smart self sufficient w.r.t using the module Take a look at the How Might We document that was prepared. Do take note of the Must Should Could classification of the 7 needs. How Might We Document How Might We PDF 4.2 The BrainStorm. Brainstorm All UX UI processes eventually leads to this phase. We have talked to the users, understood them. We have identified their needs, thought about it, thought about all the different ways we can do justice to them. Now, we talk about solving them. For every need, we had formed a set of How Might Wes, which you have been through. Then I brainstorm on each need, considering every one of the How Might Wes and come up with actual real world solutions. Although I specified real world solutions, I clarify that by no means care about it s implementational feasibility in the said project. Succeed in failing to bother about the expense or effort required and in determining if they are practical in the current context. Brainstorm. Come up with every and any possible solution that shall satisfy the need at hand. The How Might We document, acts as a guide that encourages us to explore different kinds or different approaches of solutions to the same problem. I must say, even though the How Might We was prepared by me, if not for the documentation of all those How Might Wes, I would have failed to come up with as many solutions as I have for each need while brainstorming on them. One would satisfy oneself with one or two approaches and ignore the less plausible ones. The less plausible ones, may eventually turn out to be the most effective. Brainstorm Document Branstorm Document PDF 4.3 The Brainstorm Convergence. The liberty I enjoyed thus far, ends here. This is where one starts taking the role of a responsible adult, and encourage practical thought. Which of those ideas fit the bill? Which among them fits within the bill? Do we have the technical capacity to carry out these solutions? Do we have the expertise? Are these features desirable enough to invest in? Will the return of investment be favourable? Do the users really want these features? Can we accept the time and human resource that must be put into these solutions? These questions are bound to strike off a couple of those amazing ideas one would think up in a brainstorming session. An effective way to do this, is using a 2X2 Matrix. Where the desirability of a solution is pitted against it s feasibility. Convergence The solutions that are high on desirability and high on feasibility are known as low hanging fruit and they are prioritized during implementation. All Brainstorm Convergence Graphs 4.4 The Wire frame The Visual Design. Design Pen and Paper models were framed based on the suggestions put forward by the users, gathered during the discovery stage, and the Post Prioritization list of brainstormed ideas. Here, the layout and visual structure is represented using lines and shapes. Tool like Adobe Illustrator can be made use of to this effect. I felt more comfortable with Pen and Paper models, as it was sufficient for this task. Visual Design involves evolving the wireframe into a high level design, a visual depiction of how the platform would finally look to the user. Design software and tools like InVision, Balsamiq, even Photoshop Illustrator or Adobe s new XD, are used at this stage. 4.5 The Prototype. Prototyping is where the process moves into code. The basic code structure. This is the task of a front-end developer, which also forms a subset of UX. At the time this blog was penned down, I was in this stage.

      "text": "IRIS, NITK Annual Report 2023-24 As we reflect upon the journey of IRIS into its eighth year since its inception in 2016, the past year has been a testament to its continued evolution and impactful expansion. In the year 2023-24 too, IRIS demonstrated its unwavering commitment to excellence, innovation, and service enhancement across various dimensions. IRIS Website New Launches Testing and Consultancy Module T C Module s Statistics Page Traditionally, managing consultancy projects at NITK involved a cumbersome process with extensive paperwork and administrative complexities. However, the introduction of the Testing and Consultancy (T C) module on IRIS has transformed this experience. NITK faculty can now submit project proposals effortlessly in just six steps via IRIS, specifying affiliation, co-investigators, collaborating companies, project charges, and uploading essential documents. The module also includes functionalities for requesting additional information, generating client payment forms and proforma invoices, and monitoring project funds. Admins benefit from features like setting recommenders, creating cash flow records, and accessing a comprehensive statistics tab for in-depth project insights, significantly enhancing administrative control and project management efficiency. The module s development began in January 2023 as a consultancy project and was completed in June 2024. As of June 24, the module has received 1000 projects from 650 companies, which continues to expand. As an extension to T C, a Research and Development (R D) module was also sanctioned in Oct 23, which is in its final stages of completion. This will enable the NITK faculties and administration to effectively manage and track the end-to-end life cycle of these projects. Developers: Hrushikesh J, RS Muthukumar, Anirudh Prabhakaran Product Managers: Rakshita Varadarajan, Guhan Siddharth Manager: Sushanth Rao, Akshay Revankar Principle Investigator: Dr. Mohit P Tahiliani NEP Category C Courses Allocation NEP Category C Courses Allocation Student s Dashboard Aligning with the National Education Policy (NEP), IRIS successfully implemented the allocation of Category C Liberal Arts courses in just one month. This comprehensive module played a pivotal role in handling applications from over 2000 students. With the admin panel, the courses, seat matrix, and deadlines can be configured. Students could fill in their preferences, and the system auto-calculated their allocated course based on the CGPA, with the entrance exam rank qualifying as a tiebreaker. With an initial hiccup, we ensured a more transparent, fair, and efficient system for the allocation process, promoting a student-centric and performance-driven approach in line with NEP guidelines. Developer: Sanjeev Holla Product Manager: Danish Juneja Manager: Parth Mittal Non Teaching Staff Recruitment Portal NTSR Landing Page NTSR Applicant Dashboard Each year the institute conducts a recruitment for Non-Teaching staff like the Registrar and Assistant Registrar. To streamline and digitize the process, the institute required a website to be built. Team IRIS successfully built a portal for any applicant to apply through an 8-step process, pay the required fees, upload documents, and track their application status. An admin panel with Role Based Access Control (RBAC) was also built to let the scrutiny committee oversee applications and shortlist candidates. The completion of Phase 1 of the project saw 2000 applications being received in a span of two months and successfully managed all the operations. Phase 2 (Oct 23 Apr 24) saw further improvements to the portal email notifications, addition of trade specializations, seating arrangement and attendance sheet generation during interviews, automatic Call Letter generation, digital Letters of Recommendations (LoRs), and numerous UI UX improvements. Website: recruitment.nitk.ac.in Developers: Parth Mittal, N Dhurva, Gaurang Velingkar, Sushanth Rao, Utkarsh Mahajan Product Managers: Danish Juneja, Guhan Siddharth, Akshay Srivastava Principal Investigator: Dr Sowmya Kamath Hostel Elections Hostel Elections for messes and hostel blocks marked a historic transition to a digital platform, courtesy of IRIS. Our dedicated module facilitated this process, recording an impressive 6.5k votes with a substantial 56.15 voter turnout. Remarkably, we developed this module in just 15 days, leveraging a simple yet effective interface using IRIS Forms. Ensuring both anonymity and security, our system allowed individuals to cast their votes for their respective messes and hostel blocks only.

Developer: Utkarsh IRIS Labs Hardware For the first time ever, IRIS forayed into the hardware space as well. As a start, they participated and successfully made a submission for the Efabless Open MPW (multi Project Wafer) Shuttle Program. Sponsored by Google, the program provides free silicon fabrication for open-source projects. They used technologies like OpenLane, the SkyWater Project Development Kit (PDK), and the Caravel template SoC, among others. An entire blog on their journey so far and a deep dive into the tech have been outlined in this blog. We have also received projects in collaboration with CSD. One project entails working on a locking system for the Vidyug e-cycles. Another project is on creating a QR-based automatic entry system for various entities within the college (similar to how boarding passes work in airports). Work has started on both projects. Software The software team explored the realm of Natural Language Processing and its possible integration with the Gyan module of IRIS. The initial focus was to train a Machine Learning model based on the current set of Gyans filled by students and present a quick summary of few companies helping students grab the crux of the discussion. In the latter half, the team also shifted their focus to explore Large Language Models (LLMs). They successfully integrated Meta s open-source model, Llama3, with the IRIS knowledge base. In the future, users will be able to ask questions to a chatbot to navigate through the IRIS Website or its services. The product is in internal beta-testing. The Labs Team also conducted multiple workshops throughout the year on topics like Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs), and IC design using OpenLane. These workshops received an overwhelming response from the students, with an average of 60 students for each. Miscellaneous Statistics IRIS Daily Active Users The website saw a peak of 8000 active users in October. The average daily active users stayed at around 7000 users. Controller Wise Hits The above graph represents the Controller-wise (or Module wise) Hits over the year. The top modules were: 1. Students with 7M hits 2. Courses with 5M hits 3. Roles (actions required to check access and roles of users) with 3.8M hits. Media IRIS, NITK launched its X (formerly Twitter) handle to post more frequent product and technical updates in the form of Tweets and Threads. We posted 60 posts over the year with a growing response. The team also explored some new formats, such as Reels on Instagram and multiple stories for increased interactions. Case Study by Postman Postman, a platform used to build and test APIs used by over 30M developers worldwide, published a case study on IRIS. The blog is in the form of an interview with Dr. Mohit P Tahiliani, Faculty Advisor, IRIS. The blog can be found here Talks Mohammed Arfath gave a talk titled Inside IRIS: Exploring and Contributing to Open Source Solutions for University Administration at FOSS United s first ever Mangalore Meetup on 20th April, 2024. Shashank SM and Parth Mittal delivered a talk at Postman s API Day Coastal Karnataka on November 26th 2023, talking about IRIS and the usage of Postman by the App team in their workflow. Others Discord The team transitioned all internal communication from WhatsApp groups to Discord. Each team now has a dedicated channel with role-based access control, and issues are discussed in separate threads. This shift has significantly enhanced productivity by reducing distractions and ensuring all members stay updated without needing to re-share information or switch contexts. Tags are used to notify members, and a complete history of all messages is maintained for future reference. Sprints The team conducted two 24-hour sprints, during which the entire team assembled in the Central Computing Centre to discuss and solve multiple issues quickly. This concluded with a team dinner. Supademo The Product team leveraged an AI-powered tool called Supademo to create interactive module guides. Five such module guides have been created so far.

In the year 2023-24 too, IRIS demonstrated its unwavering commitment to excellence, innovation, and service enhancement across various dimensions.\nIRIS Website \nNew Launches \nTesting and Consultancy Module \nT&C Module’s Statistics Page\nTraditionally, managing consultancy projects at NITK involved a cumbersome process with extensive paperwork and administrative complexities. However, the introduction of the Testing and Consultancy (T&C) module on IRIS has transformed this experience.\nNITK faculty can now submit project proposals effortlessly in just six steps via IRIS, specifying affiliation, co-investigators, collaborating companies, project charges, and uploading essential documents. The module also includes functionalities for requesting additional information, generating client payment forms and proforma invoices, and monitoring project funds. Admins benefit from features like setting recommenders, creating cash flow records, and accessing a comprehensive statistics tab for in-depth project insights, significantly enhancing administrative control and project management efficiency.\nThe module’s development began in January 2023 as a consultancy project and was completed in June 2024. As of June’24, the module has received 1000+ projects from 650+ companies, which continues to expand. \nAs an extension to T&C, a Research and Development (R&D) module was also sanctioned in Oct’23, which is in its final stages of completion. This will enable the NITK faculties and administration to effectively manage and track the end-to-end life cycle of these projects.\nDevelopers: Hrushikesh J, RS Muthukumar, Anirudh Prabhakaran \nProduct Managers: Rakshita Varadarajan, Guhan Siddharth \nManager: Sushanth Rao, Akshay Revankar\nPrinciple Investigator: Dr. Mohit P Tahiliani\nNEP Category C Courses Allocation \nNEP Category C Courses Allocation Student’s Dashboard\nAligning with the National Education Policy (NEP), IRIS successfully implemented the allocation of Category C Liberal Arts courses in just one month. This comprehensive module played a pivotal role in handling applications from over 2000 students. With the admin panel, the courses, seat matrix, and deadlines can be configured. Students could fill in their preferences, and the system auto-calculated their allocated course based on the CGPA, with the entrance exam rank qualifying as a tiebreaker. With an initial hiccup, we ensured a more transparent, fair, and efficient system for the allocation process, promoting a student-centric and performance-driven approach in line with NEP guidelines.\nDeveloper: Sanjeev Holla\nProduct Manager: Danish Juneja\nManager: Parth Mittal\nNon Teaching Staff Recruitment Portal \nNTSR Landing Page\nNTSR Applicant Dashboard\nEach year the institute conducts a recruitment for Non-Teaching staff like the Registrar and Assistant Registrar. To streamline and digitize the process, the institute required a website to be built. Team IRIS successfully built a portal for any applicant to apply through an 8-step process, pay the required fees, upload documents, and track their application status. An admin panel with Role Based Access Control (RBAC) was also built to let the scrutiny committee oversee applications and shortlist candidates. The completion of Phase 1 of the project saw 2000+ applications being received in a span of two months and successfully managed all the operations.\nPhase 2 (Oct’23 – Apr’24) saw further improvements to the portal – email notifications, addition of trade specializations, seating arrangement and attendance sheet generation during interviews, automatic Call Letter generation, digital Letters of Recommendations (LoRs), and numerous UI/UX improvements.\nWebsite: recruitment.nitk.ac.in\nDevelopers: Parth Mittal, N Dhurva, Gaurang Velingkar, Sushanth Rao, Utkarsh Mahajan\nProduct Managers: Danish Juneja, Guhan Siddharth, Akshay Srivastava\nPrincipal Investigator: Dr Sowmya Kamath\nHostel Elections \nHostel Elections for messes and hostel blocks marked a historic transition to a digital platform, courtesy of IRIS.

Deprecated widgets have been upgraded, and unsupported packages have been replaced with suitable alternatives. The code base has been refactored to ensure uniformity among widgets and functions. App routing has been improved to allow for potential deep linking. Redundant calls and null checks have been removed to enhance app rendering speed. Error logging in the app has been improved for better diagnostics.\nDevelopers: Shashank S M, Shashank G, Anirudh V Gubbi, Nishant A S, \nShashank Jain, Aman Revankar, Akshat B, Vishak Kamath\nMess Finance \nStudents pay a mess fee each semester, but their balance often remains unused during breaks and can be refunded later. To help track mess balances, the hostel office now uploads credit and debit details for each student via CSV files, viewable within a specified date range. Students can easily access their monthly mess balance statements through the app, ensuring full visibility and control over their unused balances.\nDeveloper: Abhishek Satpathy\nID Card Widget \nIRIS created its first ever widget for Android using native Kotlin to give quick access for ID checks in college.\nIt is designed in such a manner that the widget info is rendered correctly with every login and cleared with every logout.\nDeveloper: Anirudh V Gubbi\nEnhancements and Fixes \nCalendar and Events Management System \nCEMS has been upgraded to include actions relevant to the convener, such as creating and modifying events. Relevant checks have been added to ensure that only the responsible member for the respective club can perform these actions.\nConveners can now directly make an infrastructure booking with the related CEMS event without having to separately make a booking via the Infrastructure Booking Module.\nDevelopers: Nishant A S\nCareer Development Centre & Gyan \nCDC now provides internship and placement information for respective companies, similar to the web version. A list of placed students can also be viewed on the app. The contact details of Internship and Placement coordinators can also be viewed.\nGyan has been refactored to handle various errors and edge cases, upgraded to align with the new Gyan API, and feature improved search capabilities.\nDeveloper: Shashank G, Yuvraj Wale, Vishak Kamath\nCourse Registration \nThe module has been refactored to fix several errors and enforce missing checks, ensuring functionality. UI rendering has been improved, and redundant calls have been removed.\nDeveloper: Anirudh V Gubbi\nImportant Contacts and Mess Menu Optimization \nThe Mess Menu and Important Contacts were previously stored on Google Sheets to allow respective stakeholders to easily edit the data. However, this increased the load time. Both modules have now been optimized by migrating to Firebase for these modules as well.\nDeveloper: Abhishek Sathpathy\nRoles and Permissions Fixes \nA major bug has been fixed that caused the app to crash if roles and permissions were missing. The app now logs you out and refetches permissions if they are missing.\nDeveloper: Shashank G\nEvent Management Module \nDeveloped a comprehensive module for Phoenix events to track event points and schedules. It’s currently in the final stages of completion.\nDevelopes: Shashank G, Vinit Puranik\nIRIS Systems \nLibrary – Remote Access \nIRIS, in collaboration with the Central Library, NITK has enabled Single Sign-On to a large number of subscribed databases and resources.\nFaculties, students and staff of NITK can now seamlessly explore scholarly resources from off-campus as well. IRIS joined the Indian Access Management Federation (INFED) in this process.\nLink: https://irisni.tk/remote-library\nDevelopers: Akshay Revankar\nEduroam WiFi Integration \nEduroam is an international Wi-Fi internet access roaming service for users in research, higher education, and further education. Users who have an EDU email ID on IRIS can use eduroam in other institutions and public spaces that have the “eduroam” SSID and connect to their WiFi using the same credentials. \nDevelopers: Sushanth Rao, Akshay Revankar\nNFS Server & DB Update and Migration \nWe updated and migrated our NFS server and database. This critical task enhanced system reliability and performance, ensuring everything ran smoothly.\nDevelopers: Vinayak, Amogh\nIPv6 Migration \nOur team has been working towards migrating all IRIS services to IPv6, future-proofing our network and improving efficiency. \nDevelopers: Amogh, Vinayak, Rishi, Utkarsh\nRuby 3 and Dockerfile \nWe upgraded our applications to Ruby 3 and refined our Dockerfile configurations. These updates promised better performance and more seamless deployments, paving the way for smoother development workflows.\nDevelopers: Vedant, Arfath\nJWT Cookie Authentication \nWe implemented JWT cookie authentication, bolstering our security measures and ensuring safer and more secure user sessions. This enhancement was key to protecting our users’ data.\nDeveloper: Abdul Wasey\nLoad Testing \nThe team has been working on conducting load testing using Grafana Cloud K6 for smoother hostel allotments in the future. These would ensure end-to-end automated testing of the hostel allotment process.\nDevelopers: Devaansh, Vinit, Utkarsh\nCertificate Updation \nWe updated our certificates to maintain secure and trusted connections across all services. This routine update was essential for sustaining the integrity and security of our communications.\nStaging Server Enhancements \nThe staging server is our in-house developed Django-based web platform designed to streamline the deployment and testing of dockerized web applications. Each branch can be deployed with one click and can be tested by the Product Team without having to pull or push changes locally.\nSignificant improvements were made to our staging server. We moved nginx from host to Docker, enhanced the console and log viewer/UI, and conducted a thorough system cleanup. Additionally, we introduced a repositories module for our open-sourced project.\nIt’s been made open source and is available here.\nDevelopers: Devaansh, Abdul, Arfath, Utkarsh, Rishi\nNTSR CI/CD \nThe team automated the deployment of changes for the Non-Teaching Recruitment Portal using a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment flow.\nDeveloper: Utkarsh\nIRIS Labs \nHardware \nFor the first time ever, IRIS forayed into the hardware space as well. As a start, they participated and successfully made a submission for the Efabless Open MPW (multi Project Wafer) Shuttle Program. Sponsored by Google, the program provides free silicon fabrication for open-source projects. They used technologies like OpenLane, the SkyWater Project Development Kit (PDK), and the Caravel template SoC, among others.\nAn entire blog on their journey so far and a deep dive into the tech have been outlined in this blog.\nWe have also received projects in collaboration with CSD. One project entails working on a locking system for the Vidyug e-cycles. Another project is on creating a QR-based automatic entry system for various entities within the college (similar to how boarding passes work in airports). Work has started on both projects.\nSoftware \nThe software team explored the realm of Natural Language Processing and its possible integration with the Gyan module of IRIS. The initial focus was to train a Machine Learning model based on the current set of Gyans filled by students and present a quick summary of few companies – helping students grab the crux of the discussion.\nIn the latter half, the team also shifted their focus to explore Large Language Models (LLMs). They successfully integrated Meta’s open-source model, Llama3, with the IRIS knowledge base. In the future, users will be able to ask questions to a chatbot to navigate through the IRIS Website or its services. The product is in internal beta-testing.\nThe Labs Team also conducted multiple workshops throughout the year on topics like Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs), and IC design using OpenLane. These workshops received an overwhelming response from the students, with an average of 60+ students for each.\nMiscellaneous \nStatistics \nIRIS’ Daily Active Users\nThe website saw a peak of 8000 active users in October. The average daily active users stayed at around 7000 users.\nController Wise Hits\nThe above graph represents the Controller-wise (or Module wise) Hits over the year.\nThe top modules were:\n1. Students with 7M hits\n2. Courses with 5M hits\n3. Roles (actions required to check access and roles of users) with 3.8M hits.\nMedia \nIRIS, NITK launched its X (formerly Twitter) handle to post more frequent product and technical updates in the form of Tweets and Threads. We posted 60+ posts over the year with a growing response.\nThe team also explored some new formats, such as Reels on Instagram and multiple stories for increased interactions.\nCase Study by Postman \nPostman, a platform used to build and test APIs used by over 30M developers worldwide, published a case study on IRIS. The blog is in the form of an interview with Dr. Mohit P Tahiliani, Faculty Advisor, IRIS.\nThe blog can be found here – https://blog.postman.com/postman-classroom-program-nitk/\nTalks \nMohammed Arfath gave a talk titled “Inside IRIS: Exploring and Contributing to Open Source Solutions for University Administration” at FOSS United’s first ever Mangalore Meetup on 20th April, 2024.\nShashank SM and Parth Mittal delivered a talk at Postman’s API Day Coastal Karnataka on November 26th 2023, talking about IRIS and the usage of Postman by the App team in their workflow.\nOthers \nDiscord – The team transitioned all internal communication from WhatsApp groups to Discord. Each team now has a dedicated channel with role-based access control, and issues are discussed in separate threads. This shift has significantly enhanced productivity by reducing distractions and ensuring all members stay updated without needing to re-share information or switch contexts. Tags are used to notify members, and a complete history of all messages is maintained for future reference.\nSprints – The team conducted two 24-hour sprints, during which the entire team assembled in the Central Computing Centre to discuss and solve multiple issues quickly. This concluded with a team dinner. \nSupademo – The Product team leveraged an AI-powered tool called Supademo to create interactive module guides. Five such module guides have been created so far. An example of the Forms Module can be found here.\nList of Team Members \nCore Team \nSl.No\tName\tPosition\tRole\tBranch\t\n1.\tParth Mittal\tTech Lead\t2024\tElectronics & Communication\t\n2.\tDanish Juneja\tAdmin Lead\t2024\tElectronics & Communication\t\n3.\tHrushikesh J\tHead of Maintenance\t2024\tComputer Science\t\n4.\tShashank SM\tApp Lead\t2024\tComputer Science\t\n5.\tAnanya Chavali\tProduct Lead\t2024\tChemical\t\n6.\tAmogh Umesh\tSystems Lead\t2024\tComputer Science\t\n7.\tVinayak J Vatsalya\tSystems Lead\t2024\tInformation Technology\t\n8.\tRS Muthukumar\tWeb Lead\t2024\tElectronics & Communication\t\n9.\tVedant Anup Tarale\tWeb Lead\t2025\tElectronics & Communication\t\n10.\tAnirudh Prabhakaran\tLabs Lead\t2024\tElectronics & Communication\t\nWeb Team \nSl.No\tName\tBatch\tBranch\t\n1.\tAditya Agarwal\t2024\tElectronics & Communication\t\n2.\tN Dhruva\t2025\tElectronics & Communication\t\n3.\tHarshit Gupta\t2025\tComputer Science\t\n4.\tMinank KP\t2025\tInformation Technology\t\n5.\tSanjeev Holla S\t2026\tInformation Technology\t\n6.\tBharath N\t2026\tInformation Technology\t\n7.\tPranav Simha N\t2026\tElectronics & Communication\t\n8.\tAnush Dattanand Revankar\t2026\tArtificial Intelligence\t\n9.\tAditya Raj Pandia\t2026\tElectronics & Communication\t\n10.\tCalisto Abel Mathias\t2027\tInformation Technology\t\n11.\tAgnirudra Sil\t2027\tCivil Engineering\t\nApp Team \nSl.No\tName\tBatch\tBranch\t\n1.\tAnirudh V Gubbi\t2025\tComputer Science\t\n2.\tShashank G\t2025\tComputer Science\t\n3.\tAbhishek Sathpathy\t2025\tInformation Technology\t\n4.\tWale Yuvraj Ravindra\t2025\tElectrical & Electronics\t\n5.\tK Vinit Puranik\t2025\tElectronics & Communication\t\n6.\tM Vishak Kamath\t2026\tElectronics & Communication\t\n7.\tNishant A S\t2027\tElectrical and Electronics \t\n8.\tAkshat Bharara\t2027\tComputer Science\t\n9.\tAman Dattanand Revankar\t2026\tInformation Technology\t\n10.\tShashank Jain\t2026\tInformation Technology\t\nSystems Team \nSl.No\tName\tBatch\tBranch\t\n1.\tUtkarsh Mahajan\t2024\tElectronics & Communication\t\n2.\tM R Rishi\t2024\tMechanical\t\n3.\tDevaansh Kumar\t2025\tComputer Science\t\n4.\tMohammed Arfath\t2025\tMechanical\t\n5.\tK Vinit Puranik\t2025\tElectronics & Communication\t\n6.\tVedant Anup Tarale\t2025\tElectronics & Communication\t\n7.\tAbdul Wasey\t2026\tMetallurgy\t\n8.\tAshutosh Vikash Shukla\t2026\tInformation Technology\t\n9.\tAkshat Chaturvedi\t2026\tInformation Technology\t\n10.\tShanjiv A\t2027\tComputer Science\t\nLabs Team \nSl.No\tName\tBatch\tBranch\t\n1.\tK A Gaganashree\t2024\tElectronics & Communication\t\n2.\tHriday Mehta\t2025\tMechanical\t\n3.\tKeerthi Bhushan\t2025\tElectronics & Communication\t\n4.\tMohammed Arfath\t2025\tMechanical\t\n5.\tHarshith Puram\t2025\tComputer Science\t\n6.\tDruvika Nuthalapati\t2025\tElectrical and Electronics\t\n7.\tPreetam Bolla\t2025\tElectrical and Electronics\t\n8.\tAhan Prasannakumar Shetty\t2026\tElectronics & Communication\t\n9.\tSyed Abubaker Bin Junaid\t2026\tElectronics & Communication\t\n10.\tKushal Gowda C R\t2026\tElectronics & Communication\t\nProduct Team \nSl.No\tName\tBatch\tBranch\t\n1.\tFahim Ahmed\t2025\tInformation Technology\t\n2.\tAadarsh Lakshmi Narasiman\t2025\tComputer Science\t\n3.\tVandana S\t2025\tElectronics & Communication\t\n4.\tAkshay Shrivastava\t2025\tMechanical\t\n5.\tAkash Gowda H U\t2026\tMechanical\t\n6.\tShashank Gupta\t2026\tInformation Technology\t\n7.\tArjun R\t2026\tComputer Science\t\nMedia Team \nSl.No\tName\tBatch\tBranch\t\n1\tChirag S\t2026\tComputer Science\t\nAlumni Mentors \nSl.No\tName\tBatch\tBranch\t\n1.\tAkshay Revankar\t2018\tElectronics & Communication\t\n2.\tSushanth Satesh Rao\t2023\tElectrical and Electronics\t\n3.\tHarsh Vardhan Jain\t2022\tElectronics & Communication\t\n4.\tSalman Shah\t2019\tInformation Technology\t\n5.\tGaurang Velingkar\t2023\tInformation Technology\t\n6.\tVithik Shah\t2021\tInformation Technology\t\nFaculty \nSl.No\tName\tRole\t\n1.\tDr. Mohit P Tahiliani\tFaculty Advisor, IRIS, NITK\t\n2.\tDr. Basavraj Talwar\tFaculty-in-Charge, MIS Office\t\n3.\tDr K V Gangadharan\tDean Planning and Development\t\n4.\tDr. Satyabodh M Kulkarni\tFormer Dean Research & Consultancy\t\nMIS Office \nSl.No\tName\tRole\t\n1.\tGangadhara B\tMIS Officer\t\n2.\tArun Kumar\tMIS Officer\t\nFollow us for more exciting updates on our socials!\nInstagram | LinkedIn | Twitter",

      "text": "IRIS Recruitment Procedure for Students What is IRIS? Team IRIS (Integrated Resource and Information Sharing) system is an initiative to replace all manual paper work based system followed within NITK to make it technologically strong in terms of it s data and resource management. Our goal is to provide necessary features at one place in order to make the workflow easier for students, faculties and the administration. Under the guidance and resources provided by Dr K V Gangadharan, Center for System Design, NITK Surathkal, we started on our journey to build IRIS. Today, We are working on several modules as and when the need arises or on the ones that have been pre-planned on our roadmap. IRIS Modules worked on over the summer Some of the modules that we have worked over the summer that are currently deployed and are being used are as follows: Launch of IRIS TIMES: Launching the IRIS Blog which can be found at to talk about various Product Releases for IRIS. Status: Currently in Production Placement Module: Integration of Placement Module on IRIS to allow students to apply for Internships and Placements on IRIS. Status: Currently in Production Hostel Module: Random Hostel Room Allotment of 2nd Year and 3rd Year B Tech Students on IRIS to allow them to pick Roommate Groups and Wing Groups. Status: Currently in Production Finance Module: Integration of Paypal and Billdesk on IRIS to pay Fees on IRIS. Currently completed with 2.05 Crore rupees worth of transaction on IRIS. Status: Currently in Production PhD Module: Complete PhD Module Integration and Testing, demo on 17th July to respective faculties in charge and Dean Research and Consultancy Status: Currently in Review Admission Module: Admission Module changes as requested by admin for B. Tech., M. Tech. admissions. Status: Currently in Production IRIS UX-UI Dashboard: Improving the IRIS UX using feedback from different users and building on that knowledge to improve the UI as well. Status: Currently in Review CEMS Module: Calendar and Events Management System to allow for all kinds of Events which are hosted in NITK and push it systematically to all students. Currently in Alpha Testing. Status: Currently in Testing IRIS Android for Placements: Developing IRIS Android for Placement Module, currently in Beta Testing. Status: Currently in Review IRIS Server and Networks: Currently developing a DevOps automation to ensure all code is directly updated to production without Team Lead having to manually copy paste code. Status: Currently in Production Infrastructure Module: Development of IRIS Infrastructure Module to allow for room bookings, including Guest House Bookings as requested by Student Council, via Dean R C. Integration of this Module with CEMS will be looked into soon enough. Status: Currently in Review NIRF Module: Development of the NIRF Module to collect data for all rankings and establish IRIS as a system for information retrieval. Status: Currently in Review Process to apply for IRIS The IRIS Recruitment Procedure is a 3-step process which looks out for a specific skillset from the candidates who apply for a particular role. Step 1: Task Completion Login to IRIS NITK and go select the button to Login to Moodle. IRIS Dashboard Select IRIS Recruitment 2018 under the My Courses Block at the end of the page. Moodle Dashboard Read through the Intro, Current and Planned Modules and Technical Overview to have a basic understanding of the requirements for the given roles. Recruitment Page Fill the General Questionnaire as that is a compulsory task to have a general background about the candidates applying to the team. You are allowed to apply for one or more teams. Feel free to ask us questions regarding any of the recruitment tasks in case you are confused. Step 2: Technical Interviews All technical interviews will be taken by the respective teams and the Team Manager. To have a full list of team members, do check out the IRIS Team Page. Technical Interviews will contain a detailed discussion about the respective tasks and also interviewers will gauge the knowledge of the candidate in the respective field. P.S. No DSA questions will be asked. :p Step 3: HR Interviews Once candidates are selected from technical interviews, the HR Interviews will be taken by the IRIS Team Leads, (Salman Shah and Manish Kumar) for the year 2018-2019. Candidates will be asked questions ranging from their interests to their motivation to work at IRIS. P.S. All candidates are requested not to make up stuff as it is quite easy to spot it and will lead to immediate rejection. Teams at IRIS NITK IRIS Backend One of the oldest teams at IRIS NITK, this team basically works with Ruby on Rails and develops modules according to requirements provided the administration. Considered to be a pure Software Engineering team, this team has been the backbone of all the teams at IRIS NITK. Tasks for this year can be found at: Backend Task Link There are currently two tasks which have been released and applicants are expected to complete any one of the two tasks. Bonus points will be given if the applicants complete both the tasks. Applicants can use any MVC technology(Rails Django MEAN Stack Spring Laravel etc) (not restricted to just Rails, using Python Frameworks is also perfectly okay). Make a web application to get user data (First Name, Last Name, Email, Roll No, Registration No.) from IRIS using IRIS OAuth API and display it. Applicants are requested to go through the IRIS OAuth Documentation and use a MVC Application for the same. Design a complaint system for NITK using any MVC architecture (Rails Django MEAN Stack Spring Laravel etc). The application must take into account both the student and the administration part of NITK and allow complaints to be resolved both ways. Both the tasks are given in much more detail, on the given link . IRIS Systems Systems along with IRIS Backend is the one of the other older teams at Team IRIS, which has been managing servers at IRIS NITK. Currently the team is looking to expand with the arrival of a new server at the beginning of this semester. The Systems Team currently manages three servers at and upcoming projects include Dockerisation of the complete server architecture and implementing CI-CD for the development process. Tasks for the year can be found at: Systems Task Link Installing a Virtual Machine LXD containers and Nginx Web Server SSL Certificate Complete details about the task can be found on the given link. IRIS Android IRIS Android is a one year old team which is currently looking at releasing the first release of the IRIS Android App by the mid-September. The team works continuously with the Backend team in ensuring and getting the required APIs that are to fetched. Applicants working with this team have to be thorough with the concept of GET and POST Requests and have a basic understanding of the Android Architecture. Tasks for the year can be found at: Android Task Link You are required to parse raw JSON data fetched from the server and display it on the Android device in form of a list. You are suggested to make use of Android Volley networking library for the purpose. Kindly check out the Android Task Link for more information about the same. Do check out for complete information about the task. IRIS UX-UI IRIS UX-UI is amongst the newer teams that work towards ensuring User Experience and User Interfaces for the users who use IRIS NITK.

      "text": "IRIS-NodeBB Forum - IRIS Blog Overview Alone we can do so little, together we can do so much Helen Keler Drawing inspiration from various product platforms, IRIS-NodeBB Forum is the gateway to unite all the sections of the NITK student community and build a stronger close-knit peer environment under a community-driven discussion platform. This has been made possible by integrating NodeBB, one of the leading free and open source third-party forum software with IRIS. Why Forum? IRIS-NodeBB Forum has been built to achieve the goal of bringing together the varied passions, knowledge and experience of NITK students under an umbrella medium that would promote sharing of ideas, opinions and suggestions among users. In a world where billions of opportunities and uncertainties exist, this new product serves as the perfect recipe to share and gain perspective, to make one s college life more fruitful. The Forum environment gathers all the alumni, B.Tech, M.Tech, Ph.D, M.Sc and MBA students together, thereby ensuring that the needs and interests of all the community members are met. The long term vision of this product is to enable students to have healthy conversations regarding a wide range of topics such as academics, sports, student activities and clubs, current affairs, career guidance, etc.,. Channels The first version of Forum has seven channels: Forum Announcements: All the news and updates related to IRIS-NodeBB Forum shall be posted here. Only the forum admins and moderators are permitted to post in this channel. However, the posts can be viewed by all the users of the Forum. It is to be noted that all the official announcements shall be made via IRIS, and not through the Forum. Academics: This channel is dedicated to all the academics-related topics. Students are encouraged to engage in constructive conversations about the degree subjects, course projects, minor degree, honours, etc. Higher Studies: Any discussion related to the planning, application procedures, entrance examinations, choice of university, etc., for post graduate and other higher education programs such as masters, PhD, etc., can be carried out here. Student Life: This channel is meant for conversations regarding student activities such as fests and extra-curricular activities, campus facilities such as hostels, popular tourist hotspots near NITK, leisure activities over the weekend, etc.,. The Lost and Found channel under the On Campus section can be used by students to enquire inform others about any lost item and return it to the concerned person. However, all the users need to ensure that sensitive information such as card numbers from lost ATM debit cards, etc., are not revealed in the post (Hide the sensitive details suitably while sharing images) Everything IRIS: This channel pertains to anything with respect to IRIS. This is the best avenue for students to actively involve with Team IRIS and make requests and suggestions for improvements and new products. Problems faced by students while using IRIS can be brought up here. The issues raised shall be handled actively by the IRIS Product team. Hobbies: Topics related to one s interests and hobbies such as coding, automobiles, sports, arts, etc., can be brainstormed and discussed here. Student Council: The Forum also provides an opportunity for students to stay in touch with their elected representatives. Constructive dialog for the betterment and further empowerment of the student community can be carried out here. Career Opportunities: This channel is dedicated to discussions regarding research internships, off-campus internships, and placement opportunities. It provides a platform for students and alumni to share their experiences and resources to help peers and juniors discover and apply for opportunities outside NITK.

      "original_text": "IRIS-NodeBB Forum - IRIS Blog\nOverview \n“Alone we can do so little, together we can do so much” – Helen Keler\nDrawing inspiration from various product platforms, IRIS-NodeBB Forum is the gateway to unite all the sections of the NITK student community and build a stronger close-knit peer environment under a community-driven discussion platform. This has been made possible by integrating NodeBB, one of the leading free and open source third-party forum software with IRIS.\nWhy Forum? \nIRIS-NodeBB Forum has been built to achieve the goal of bringing together the varied passions, knowledge and experience of NITK students under an umbrella medium that would promote sharing of ideas, opinions and suggestions among users. In a world where billions of opportunities and uncertainties exist, this new product serves as the perfect recipe to share and gain perspective, to make one’s college life more fruitful. \nThe Forum environment gathers all the alumni, B.Tech, M.Tech, Ph.D, M.Sc and MBA students together, thereby ensuring that the needs and interests of all the community members are met. The long term vision of this product is to enable students to have healthy conversations regarding a wide range of topics such as academics, sports, student activities and clubs, current affairs, career guidance, etc.,. \nChannels \nThe first version of Forum has seven channels:\nForum Announcements: \nAll the news and updates related to IRIS-NodeBB Forum shall be posted here.

However, all the users need to ensure that sensitive information such as card numbers from lost ATM/debit cards, etc., are not revealed in the post (Hide the sensitive details suitably while sharing images)\nEverything IRIS:\nThis channel pertains to anything with respect to IRIS.

Constructive dialog for the betterment and further empowerment of the student community can be carried out here.\nCareer Opportunities:\nThis channel is dedicated to discussions regarding research internships, off-campus internships, and placement opportunities.

The IRIS Blog serves as a way to push these ideas and at the same time educate the NITK Community regarding the latest trends in technology that are followed. To understand the decisions made in creating IRIS-Blog, Let s understand the different possiblities we have for blog platforms, with two distinct approaches Static and Dynamic. Static Vs Dynamic Website Static Website serve the same content to every visitor from a pre-generated file. For each page of a static website, there is a unique HTML file on a web server. When a visitor types in a URL or visits a static page, the page that loads will be same for all the users. Static Websites are a straightforward collection of HTML files and their assets in a directory structure. These are then served through a web server. New pages and changes are made by someone who is familiar with HTML code. Pros Faster load time More secure less vulnerable to hacks Less expensive to host and maintain Less complex to setup Cons No CMS, knowledge of HTML required to make changes Missing functionality like E-commerce, Login Portals, etc Can t display dynamic content to users Less engaging than interactive sites Note: Static Websites are making a comeback due to static website generators, which are discussed below. See section Static Site Generators. Dynamic Website serve different content to visitors, even if they visit the same url or request the same page. When a visitor requests a page, the web server builds an HTML file depending on the parameters given by the visitor. For example WordPress, Medium Most dynamic sites use a Content Management System (CMS), that allows internal users to make updates or publish changes. Most CMS are accessible through a login interface and have a visual interface for making changes. Pros Greater interactivity Increased Functionality Easier to manage due CMS Lesser technical skills required Cons Less secure More complex to setup Slower load time More expensive to maintain Static Site Generators A new class of applications called Static Site Generators emerged, which aim to combine functionality of templating with static sites. A traditional static site is hardcoded with each of the pages, built by hand. A static site generator recognizes pages have common repeating elements, such as headers and footer. For a category of pages such as blog posts, the layout and some elements such as tags, about author are also repeated. This abstracts the visuals of the page and its contents. Prominent Site Generators are Jekyll, Hugo, Octopress, Hexo, Gatsby. Readers are advised to check out different Site Generators. About IRIS Blog IRIS Blog was started by Salman Shah in the summer of 2018. The aim is to reach out to the NITK Community with information about features of IRIS as well as provide a platform where developers can showcase their work. One of primary difficulties faced was that it was difficult to get people to write articles, due to the lack of technical details over how to write. The team wrote an extensive contribution guide, which helped integrate new users. Addition of Jekyll Admin will surely further simplify the process. Another difficulty faced was viewership, which led to articles on Fee Payment and Hostel Module. This helped the IRIS team to redirect any queries, freeing up valuable time. Jekyll was chosen over options like WordPress due to being more stable and lightweight. An additional factor was initial exposure to Jekyll rather than other solutions. Technical Details With some background on the topic, let s dive into the components which create magic. 1. Jekyll Jekyll is a simple, extendable, static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it churns through layouts to create a static website. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more. Jekyll is written as Ruby gem. Detailed Step by Step Tutorial 2. Jekyll Plugins Jekyll has a plugin system with hooks that allow you to create custom generated content specific to your site. In IRIS-Blog, we have used the following plugins. 1. Jekyll-Admin A Jekyll plugin that provides users with a traditional CMS-style graphical interface to author content and administer Jekyll sites. The project is divided into two parts. A Ruby-based HTTP API that handles Jekyll and filesystem operations, and a Javascript-based front end, built on that API. This plugin solves a major issue for Static Sites lack of graphical interface to create and edit content. While it is in early stages of development, it works well enough out of the box for most users. Jekyll Admin Documentation. Jekyll Admin 2. Jekyll-Algolia Jekyll-Algolia adds fast and relevant search to your Jekyll site. Algolia provides powerful search-as-a-service solution, made with easy to use with API clients, UI libraries, and pre-built integrations. Getting Started with Jekyll-Algolia. Search Page of IRIS Blog 3. Jekyll-SEO-Tag Jekyll SEO Tag adds metadata tags for search engines and social networks to better index and display site s content. It provides a battle-tested template of crowd sourced best-practices, and eliminates the need to add metadata tags manually. It uses data from configuration file and front matter of a page to generate tags. Metadata tags produced by Jekyll SEO Tag 4. Jekyll-Paginate Jekyll offers a pagination plugin, which automatically generates the appropriate files and folders for the paginated listings. Pagination 5. Theme Jekyll has an extensive theme system that allows you to leverage community-maintained templates and styles to customize your site s presentation. Jekyll themes specify plugins and package up assests, layouts, includes, and stylesheets in a way that can be overridden by your site s content. IRIS Blog uses the Theme Forty by HTML5 UP Theme Forty , made by HTML5 Up Contributing to IRIS-Blog Members of our community are encouraged to write articles for our blogging platform.

      "text": "IRIS Annual Report 2020-2021 - IRIS Blog There is nothing like adversity to boost ingenuity. As we battle our way through this pandemic to strive and improve IRIS, it s only fair to reminisce and never forget how we got here. It s been a little more than six years since IRIS started out. From humble beginnings to solidifying our position as the Institute s Enterprise Resource Management System, IRIS has become a necessity in times like these, especially during the pandemic. From Course registration, the very first module that we introduced, to the array of modules we introduced during the pandemic to ease our way into the current virtual environment, IRIS has been instrumental in the functioning of our Institute. Though the modules introduced last year were massive in the healthy functioning of the institute, it would be unwise not to credit the importance of the work done by the IRIS team in the past six years because the modules introduced then are reaping the rewards of acknowledgement and appreciation now. With Covid 19 forcing us into our homes, IRIS Team introduced BigBlueButton, used for video lectures; Microsoft Teams Integration, to mimic a classroom environment and is exploring other avenues to complete the virtual experience. As unpredictable as the year was and the future unbeknownst, it was absolutely important to digitise other offline processes and complete the package. We worked on virtualizing offline procedures like the PG Research module, University Information Management System, Academic Certificates, Library Book recommendation, application for various admission programs, club certificates, Projects Portal and many more. It was a proud moment for us as we unveiled the first version of the all-new IRIS mobile application developed on Flutter while mentoring the future app developers of NITK. Since numerous NITK academic activities were on IRIS, the Systems Team dived into industry-standard research and implementation to ensure the resilience of the systems and successfully set up a scalable deployment of Moodle on Kubernetes. To bridge the gap between an offline and online environment, the team worked on research and implementation of many exploratory projects like Smart Proctoring System, Virtual and Augmented Reality based Convocation completely from Open Source Tools. Nurturing future developers of NITK, IRIS initiatives like Code-In Bootcamp for Ruby on Rails (RoR) and Flutter was immensely popular among students as it attracted around 500 participants. It requires a great bunch to achieve the feat that we, as a team, accomplished last year and thus the significant proportion of credit goes to the developers, product managers and respective team managers who have put in countless shifts to maintain the standards in place and push the boundaries of innovation. The Core team was paramount in the execution and functioning of IRIS and our many modules. Last but not the least, the help and support we received from the Centre of System Design (CSD), Central Computing Centre (CCC), the MIS Office and various influential individuals who helped us push our boundaries, was significant. We will be forever grateful to Professor Ananthanarayana VS (Deputy Director and Chairman, MIS), Professor Ashvini Chaturvedi (Associate Dean UG), Prof K V Gangadharan (Coordinator, Centre for Systems Design) and Prof Mohit P Tahliani (Faculty Advisor, IRIS) for their ceaseless backing which championed us forward and being the pillars of support for the IRIS Team. The team will always be grateful for the guidance and support provided by former IRIS leads: Akshay Revankar, Salman Shah, Manish Kumar, Govind Jeevan and Pavan Vachhani. We also take this opportunity to thank the Institute s Director, Deans, HoDs and Faculties of various departments or NITK, the student council and the students of NITK for entrusting us with this responsibility and supporting us throughout the year. As we look ahead, we are more optimistic than ever of the enormous opportunity ahead of us. Innovation and Technology continue to be at the centre of change globally and we are among the best-positioned institutes to lead this change and accelerate our digital journey to realise our ever-changing objectives.

      "original_text": "IRIS Annual Report 2020-2021 - IRIS Blog\nThere is nothing like adversity to boost ingenuity. As we battle our way through this pandemic to strive and improve IRIS, it’s only fair to reminisce and never forget how we got here. It’s been a little more than six years since IRIS started out. From humble beginnings to solidifying our position as the Institute’s Enterprise Resource Management System, IRIS has become a necessity in times like these, especially during the pandemic. From Course registration, the very first module that we introduced, to the array of modules we introduced during the pandemic to ease our way into the current virtual environment, IRIS has been instrumental in the functioning of our Institute. Though the modules introduced last year were massive in the healthy functioning of the institute, it would be unwise not to credit the importance of the work done by the IRIS team in the past six years because the modules introduced then are reaping the rewards of acknowledgement and appreciation now. With Covid 19 forcing us into our homes, IRIS Team introduced BigBlueButton, used for video lectures; Microsoft Teams Integration, to mimic a classroom environment and is exploring other avenues to complete the virtual experience.\nAs unpredictable as the year was and the future unbeknownst, it was absolutely important to digitise other offline processes and complete the package. We worked on virtualizing offline procedures like the PG Research module, University Information Management System, Academic Certificates, Library Book recommendation, application for various admission programs, club certificates, Projects Portal and many more. It was a proud moment for us as we unveiled the first version of the all-new IRIS mobile application developed on Flutter while mentoring the future app developers of NITK. Since numerous NITK academic activities were on IRIS, the Systems Team dived into industry-standard research and implementation to ensure the resilience of the systems and successfully set up a scalable deployment of Moodle on Kubernetes. To bridge the gap between an offline and online environment, the team worked on research and implementation of many exploratory projects like Smart Proctoring System, Virtual and Augmented Reality based Convocation completely from Open Source Tools.

      "text": "IRIS Annual Report 2019-20 - IRIS Blog Year in Review To all our stakeholders in NITK, It is now more than four years since IRIS was first hosted to handle a round of course registrations in early 2016. The fourth year of IRIS and co-incidentally our fourth year in NITK, was remarkable in many ways. IRIS has transformed from an academics centered software, to the likes of an Enterprise Resource Management(ERP) system digitizing various aspects of the institute s functioning itself. The year saw us venturing out of our comfort zones taking up a diverse set of projects that branched out from the core IRIS application. The introduction of IRIS Labs, focused on research, artificial intelligence, and hardware projects, the development of an app for the Alumni Global Convention, undertaking the development of the institute website all attest to this era of diversification of reach. Another distinctive aspect of the year was the revamped approach of the product team and increasing the involvement of its members in the software development life cycle, with each product manager leading a functional sub-team focused on a project and seeing it to completion and release. On the technical front, we have been exploring quite a handful of open source projects that can assist the growth and scale of IRIS. The shift from native android development to the cross-platform Flutter framework which shall soon enable us to release Student and Faculty apps for Android and iOS, the experiments performed with the ElasticSearch stack, Hesk, Moodle, Koha, Kubernetes, Big Blue Button are just a few of the open-source projects that we are currently working with or have set up in the IRIS cluster. With the scale at which we operate now, ensuring maintainability for the years to come has proved to be the bigger challenge to tackle as opposed to the rapid development of new features. This year, we have tried to acknowledge this challenge and approached this by the systemic introduction of documentation standards not limited to code but also inclusive of aspects pre-development such as database schema design, software requirements specification and so on. A conscious effort has been made to ensure that all the actions required by the system are taken by the administrative authorities, gradually reducing the dependency on the development team for any process and procedure and increasing the autonomy of the users in achieving their desired results with the system. The intention of these efforts is to ensure that we are building a system that can last over the years. Our initiatives such as the Code-In-10x Internship programs and Bootcamps for Ruby on Rails and Flutter have been well received by students, aiding them in navigating the wide and confusing world of software development. These programs have undoubtedly contributed to the strengthening of the team itself with the mentees, gradually being converted to recruits who have performed remarkably well in various projects. The campus lockdown gave us a fresh set of challenges as many of our on-going projects were brought to a standstill. At the same time, it presented us with a completely different set of problems to be tackled. Integrations with Microsoft Teams, Hosting an on-premise video lecture recording solution, collaborations with MOOC platforms like edx and Coursera were done swiftly, aiding NITK to quickly transition to this new mode of operation. The team still strives to make sense of these changes, and how it affects various functions and processes, regularly coordinating with the administration in all means possible to ensure that the pandemic does not bring NITK to a disadvantage. You would find us basking in the rare glory of these activities being featured on the national dailies, with the likes of The Hindu and The Times of India covering how the in-house portal of NITK has enabled flipped classroom teaching for the institute. Centre for Systems Design, the MIS Office, the Central Computing Centre, are entities that have played significant roles in the advancements we have made this year and we thank all the staff and faculty involved for backing us as we continue to make progress. On a personal note, I feel indebted to the proactive support of Prof Ananthanarayana VS (Deputy Director and Chairman, MIS), Prof K V Gangadharan (Coordinator, Centre for Systems Design) and Prof Mohit P Tahliani (Faculty Advisor, IRIS), who have directly contributed to ensuring that IRIS is ahead of the curve in every direction. The continuing contributions and the active involvement of our alumni mentors, Akshay Revankar of 2018, Salman Shah and Manish Kumar of 2019 have played a pivotal role in shaping IRIS this year, and this spirit of commitment towards the goal is something that IRIS greatly benefits from. We end this note, expressing our wholehearted gratitude to the Director, Deans, Registrar, Assistant Registrars, HoDs, the Students Council and the entire NITK community for its support, trust and the environment that enables us to build systems for the better.

      "original_text": "IRIS Annual Report 2019-20 - IRIS Blog\nYear in Review \nTo all our stakeholders in NITK,\nIt is now more than four years since IRIS was first hosted to handle a round of course registrations in early 2016. The fourth year of IRIS and co-incidentally our fourth year in NITK, was remarkable in many ways. IRIS has transformed from an academics centered software, to the likes of an Enterprise Resource Management(ERP) system digitizing various aspects of the institute’s functioning itself. The year saw us venturing out of our comfort zones taking up a diverse set of projects that branched out from the core IRIS application. The introduction of IRIS Labs, focused on research, artificial intelligence, and hardware projects, the development of an app for the Alumni Global Convention, undertaking the development of the institute website all attest to this era of diversification of reach. Another distinctive aspect of the year was the revamped approach of the product team and increasing the involvement of its members in the software development life cycle, with each product manager leading a functional sub-team focused on a project and seeing it to completion and release. On the technical front, we have been exploring quite a handful of open source projects that can assist the growth and scale of IRIS. The shift from native android development to the cross-platform Flutter framework which shall soon enable us to release Student and Faculty apps for Android and iOS, the experiments performed with the ElasticSearch stack, Hesk, Moodle, Koha, Kubernetes, Big Blue Button are just a few of the open-source projects that we are currently working with or have set up in the IRIS cluster. \nWith the scale at which we operate now, ensuring maintainability for the years to come has proved to be the bigger challenge to tackle as opposed to the rapid development of new features. This year, we have tried to acknowledge this challenge and approached this by the systemic introduction of documentation standards not limited to code but also inclusive of aspects pre-development such as database schema design, software requirements specification and so on. A conscious effort has been made to ensure that all the actions required by the system are taken by the administrative authorities, gradually reducing the dependency on the development team for any process and procedure and increasing the autonomy of the users in achieving their desired results with the system. The intention of these efforts is to ensure that we are building a system that can last over the years.\nOur initiatives such as the Code-In-10x Internship programs and Bootcamps for Ruby on Rails and Flutter have been well received by students, aiding them in navigating the wide and confusing world of software development. These programs have undoubtedly contributed to the strengthening of the team itself with the mentees, gradually being converted to recruits who have performed remarkably well in various projects. \nThe campus lockdown gave us a fresh set of challenges as many of our on-going projects were brought to a standstill. At the same time, it presented us with a completely different set of problems to be tackled. Integrations with Microsoft Teams, Hosting an on-premise video lecture recording solution, collaborations with MOOC platforms like edx and Coursera were done swiftly, aiding NITK to quickly transition to this new mode of operation. The team still strives to make sense of these changes, and how it affects various functions and processes, regularly coordinating with the administration in all means possible to ensure that the pandemic does not bring NITK to a disadvantage. You would find us basking in the rare glory of these activities being featured on the national dailies, with the likes of The Hindu and The Times of India covering how the in-house portal of NITK has enabled flipped classroom teaching for the institute. \nCentre for Systems Design, the MIS Office, the Central Computing Centre, are entities that have played significant roles in the advancements we have made this year and we thank all the staff and faculty involved for backing us as we continue to make progress. On a personal note, I feel indebted to the proactive support of Prof Ananthanarayana VS (Deputy Director and Chairman, MIS), Prof K V Gangadharan (Coordinator, Centre for Systems Design) and Prof Mohit P Tahliani (Faculty Advisor, IRIS), who have directly contributed to ensuring that IRIS is ahead of the curve in every direction. The continuing contributions and the active involvement of our alumni mentors, Akshay Revankar of 2018, Salman Shah and Manish Kumar of 2019 have played a pivotal role in shaping IRIS this year, and this spirit of commitment towards the goal is something that IRIS greatly benefits from. We end this note, expressing our wholehearted gratitude to the Director, Deans, Registrar, Assistant Registrars, HoDs, the Students’ Council and the entire NITK community for its support, trust and the environment that enables us to build systems for the better. With this rock-solid support, there is only one way to go for IRIS, and it’s turning out to be up. \nSigning off,\nGovind Jeevan\nTeam Lead (2019-20)\nPavan Vachhani\nTeam Lead (2019-20)\nProjects Completed (2019-20) \nSl.\tProject\tContributors\tDescription\t\n1\tDesign System Migration of IRIS\tGovind Jeevan, Nirmal Khedkar, Akshay Revankar,Module Maintainers\tWeb\t\n2\tNITK Website\tGovind Jeevan, Palak Singhal, Bharath Adikar, Pavan Vachhani\tWeb\t\n3\tApplications Portal for PhD Candidates \tAbhishek Kumar, Vithik Shah, Karthik Menen\tWeb\t\n4\tVirtual Mailing List for dynamic mailing list generation\tPavan Vachhani\tWeb\t\n5\tInfrastructure Module for booking of Rooms/Venues\tPavan Vachhani, Govind Jeevan, Shivam Potdar, Shashank Hs\tWeb\t\n6\tIRIS Forms\tAditya Karia, Sahana Shanbag\tWeb\t\n7\tCalendar and Event Management System\n(CEMS)\tBharath Adikar, Rishabh Nema, Snehal Satlawar \tWeb\t\n8\tSmrithi Testimonials Platform\tAdarsh Naidu, Rishabh Nema, Govind Jeevan, Palak Singhal, Yash Agarwal\tWeb\t\n9\tIntegration with BigBlueButton for Lecture Recording with Statistics Dashboard\tAkshay Revankar, Govind Jeevan\tSystems + Web\t\n10\tIntegration with Microsoft Teams for Automatic Team/Account Creation and Live Lectures\tGovind Jeevan\tWeb\t\n11\tCoursera & edX Collaboration\tGovind Jeevan\tProduct\t\n12\tAlumni Global Convention App\tGovind Jeevan, Prajwal Belagavi, Vaibhav\tApp + Web\t\n13\tGroup Management System for Teams, Departments\tBharath Adikar\tWeb\t\n14\tAlumni Virtual ID Card\tGovind Jeevan, Pavan Vachhani, Palak Singhal\tApp + Web\t\n15\tIRIS MQTT Broker\tAkshay Revankar\tSystems\t\n16\tIRIS Droid Server: Browser based App Emulator\tGovind Jeevan\tSystems + Web\t\n17\tMinors Applications and Allotment\tGovind Jeevan, Manas Gupta\tWeb\t\n18\tIRIS Chatbot\tNachiket, Ashwin Nayak\tIRIS Labs\t\n19\tIRIS Android App\tVaibhav and Android Team\tApp\t\n20\tElasticSearch Integration\tPavan Vachhani, Aditya Jain\tSystems\t\n21\tSports Module\tManas Kinkar\tWeb\t\n22\tDigital Provisional Degree\tGovind Jeevan\tWeb\t\n23\tAutomated Points Generation for Faculty Appraisal\tGovind Jeevan\tWeb\t\n24\tStatistics for Infrastructure, Hostel Allotment, CEMS, Faculty Appraisal\tMohit R, Adithya Karia\tWeb\t\n25\tAttendance Management Improvements\tHarsha Vardhan\tWeb\t\n26\tCDC Module Refactoring and Improvements\tVithik Shah\tWeb\t\n27\tDev Server Architecture Changes\tMahim Agarwal, Adithya Pai\tSystems\t\n28\tIRIS Mascot and Graphic Designs for IRIS\tManash Sharma\tProduct\t\n29\tRefactoring and Maintenance of Admissions Portal\tAbhishek Kumar, Nirmal Khedkar\tWeb\t\n30\tInfrastructure Guest House Booking\tBharath Adikar, Vikram S, Shashank Hs\tWeb\t\nProjects Under Development \nSl.\tProject\tContributors\tDescription\t\n1\tSports Module\tManas Kinkar, Sai Pavan\tWeb\t\n2\tInfrastructure Complaints\tManas Gupta, Vikram S\tWeb\t\n3\tNo Dues for Faculty\tHarsh Prakash Gupta\tWeb\t\n4\tNITK Department Website\tGovind Jeevan, Vithik Shah, Manas Gupta, Shashank Hs, Avinash Kumar\tWeb\t\n5\tKubernetes Migration\tAditya Jain & Systems Team\tSystems\t\n6\tIRIS Flutter App\tPrajwal Belagavi, Dhanasekhar, Harshavardhan, Siddharth Ramesh and Team\tMobile\t\n7\tAcademic Certificates\tYash Agarwal, Hitesh B\tWeb\t\n8\tPhD Module\tAbhishek Kumar, Yash Agarwal, Avinash Kumar\tWeb\t\n9\tKoha Integration for Library Due Payment\tBharath Adikar\tWeb\t\n10\tBuy And Sell Platform\tSai Pavan, Harshal Shende, Sushanth Rao\tWeb\t\n11\tAcademic Projects Platform\tSanjana V Prasad, Sushanth Rao\tWeb\t\n13\tAlumni Mentorship Platform\tShreyansh Dubey, Avinash Kumar\tWeb\t\n14\tInfrastructure Assets\tAkshara P\tWeb\t\n15\tIRIS in-House RFID Access Control System\tAkshay Revankar, Ashwin Shenoy, Shivam Potdar, Govind Sunilkumar, S R Sahith\tIRIS Labs\t\n16\tIRIS App Store with F-Droid\tGovind Jeevan\tSystems\t\n17\tAnomaly Detection based protection against DoS\tMohit Mithra, Govind Jeevan\tIRIS Labs\t\n18\tCCTV Based Automated Attendance Management\tA Naga Neeramitra Reddy, Sriram A, Rishi Sharma\tIRIS Labs\t\n19\tChatbot for IRIS FAQ\tNachiket Naganure, Ashwin Shenoy\tIRIS Labs\t\n20\tNLP to SQL for Natural Language based queries to IRIS Database\tSakshat Avinash Rao, Arpit Jadiya\tIRIS Labs\t\nTeam: Organizational Chart \nTeam: Official List for 2019-20 \n* Only members who have achieved all of their target goals or released a module or have a minimum of 1 year of contribution are considered in the official list.

      "text": "Journey of IRIS - Part 1 This article written by Akshay Revankar, who is 2018 Batch Alumni from the Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) Department talks about his journey on starting IRIS. It was the second semester of college, and I had to lodge a complaint with the hostel office for some electrical issues. The manual process of going to the Hostel Office before it closes, given the heavy first-year class schedules, was very painstaking. It was also surprising to know that an Institute of National Importance had only a pen-and-paper based approach for every task. In my first year, the only available online system seemed to be the Placement website and a website by the then Humanities department (now called as School of Management). Looking at this, I started off by developing an online Hostel Complaint system using Ruby on Rails (mainly because I had worked on it for two years), with minimal information management in the backend (current hostel room and basic user information). I had shown this work to quite a few batchmates and a few seniors whom I knew as a first year but had never approached any official with the idea. I had then stopped working on it for quite a while due to exams and didn t work on it over the summer. In my third semester, I received a call from Hardik Patel (then a 5th semester Mechanical Engineering student). He told me that Prof. K V Gangadharan (KVG Sir) wanted to discuss this project that I was working on as it coincided with his interests. He had a lot of ideas as he puts it, crazy ideas and a vision of digitizing systems within the institute and even scale to outside the institute (which is yet to happen :)). The plan was initially not to involve Hostel Office with the Hostel Complaints system, but he wanted us to start with a more Academic-centric module. This was also a good approach as it allowed us to bring a lot of faculty members under the hood of this system. KVG Sir proposed that we use the Moodle as a base platform on which we were to develop our module for Course Registration. I was not happy with the idea of patching our modules onto an actively developed LMS platform as it could cause a lot of rework on updates. I decided to work on creating a system from scratch (which involved continuing the work I had done during my previous semester). KVG Sir provided us with a Virtual Machine (8GB RAM, two cores to start with) to setup the application. For the process, we started with only the Mechanical Engineering department s course registration, as KVG Sir was the HoD of the department at that time and it was therefore easier to get things moving. I don t know if it was the best decision, or the worst, but the department had the most complicated timetable, and the number of slots were just too many as we would have preferred with a more simple problem to solve. We still did try to make a system which was running in development and had Mechanical students do the first course pre-registration for the 2016 Even semester. This was quite a challenge with me being the only backend developer and Hardik providing me constant support and inputs on various issues. There were times when I had to modify the code in production while people were pre-registering for the semester! We learnt a lot of complicated cases that are possible and tried to simplify the process as much as we could. We proceeded to bring in a second department, which was the Computer Science Engineering department. The Student Council President (SCP), Anirudh Ganesh, who also belonged to the same department helped us initiate the process.

      "original_text": "Journey of IRIS - Part 1\nThis article written by Akshay Revankar, who is 2018 Batch Alumni from the Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) Department talks about his journey on starting IRIS.\nIt was the second semester of college, and I had to lodge a complaint with the hostel office for some electrical issues. The manual process of going to the Hostel Office before it closes, given the heavy first-year class schedules, was very painstaking. It was also surprising to know that an Institute of National Importance had only a pen-and-paper based approach for every task. In my first year, the only available online system seemed to be the Placement website and a website by the then Humanities department (now called as School of Management).\nLooking at this, I started off by developing an online Hostel Complaint system using Ruby on Rails (mainly because I had worked on it for two years), with minimal information management in the backend (current hostel room and basic user information). I had shown this work to quite a few batchmates and a few seniors whom I knew as a first year but had never approached any official with the idea. I had then stopped working on it for quite a while due to exams and didn’t work on it over the summer.\nIn my third semester, I received a call from Hardik Patel (then a 5th semester Mechanical Engineering student). He told me that Prof. K V Gangadharan (KVG Sir) wanted to discuss this project that I was working on as it coincided with his interests. He had a lot of ideas – as he puts it, crazy ideas and a vision of digitizing systems within the institute and even scale to outside the institute (which is yet to happen :)). The plan was initially not to involve Hostel Office with the Hostel Complaints system, but he wanted us to start with a more Academic-centric module. This was also a good approach as it allowed us to bring a lot of faculty members under the hood of this system.\nKVG Sir proposed that we use the Moodle as a base platform on which we were to develop our module for Course Registration. I was not happy with the idea of patching our modules onto an actively developed LMS platform as it could cause a lot of rework on updates.\nI decided to work on creating a system from scratch (which involved continuing the work I had done during my previous semester). KVG Sir provided us with a Virtual Machine (8GB RAM, two cores to start with) to setup the application. For the process, we started with only the Mechanical Engineering department’s course registration, as KVG Sir was the HoD of the department at that time and it was therefore easier to get things moving. I don’t know if it was the best decision, or the worst, but the department had the most complicated timetable, and the number of slots were just too many as we would have preferred with a more simple problem to solve.\nWe still did try to make a system which was running in development and had Mechanical students do the first course pre-registration for the 2016 Even semester. This was quite a challenge with me being the only backend developer and Hardik providing me constant support and inputs on various issues. There were times when I had to modify the code in production while people were pre-registering for the semester!\nWe learnt a lot of complicated cases that are possible and tried to simplify the process as much as we could. We proceeded to bring in a second department, which was the Computer Science Engineering department. The Student Council President (SCP), Anirudh Ganesh, who also belonged to the same department helped us initiate the process. It was tough, seeing most of the Computer Science department faculty members have no interest in moving to a digital system, which surprised me. But then, some of their concerns such as the continuous initiation of Online systems but no sustenance, were genuine.

The Interview There was an intership offering in the month of November 2018 by the IRIS team for the Front-End part. Since I was interested in Front-End, I had applied for it. Got a call, attended the interview where I was asked questions regarding my interest in Front-End development and the willingness to work on IRIS.
