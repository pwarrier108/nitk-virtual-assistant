      "text": "NITK Surathkal Hosts Prime Minister s Plantation Campaign Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam We are proud to share the glimpse of Prime Minister s Plantation Campaign Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam organised at NITK campus today, the initiative aiming to promote environmental sustainability and ecological balance. The event featured Air Marshal B.U. Chengappa (PVSM, AVSM, VSM, NITK Alumnus) as the Chief Guest, and Mr. Niranjana Mahbalappa, President of NITK Alumni Association Bangalore Chapter (MECH-1990), as the Guest of Honor. Prof. B. Ravi, Director, NITK, presided over the program. Addressing the gathering, Air Marshal B.U. Chengappa expressed his gratitude to NITK for organizing the event in alignment with the Prime Minister s vision of the Plantation Campaign, Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam. He emphasized the importance of forest conservation, warning that neglecting this responsibility could lead to catastrophic phenomena like landslides and extreme weather conditions. Mr. Niranjana Mahbalappa shared his personal experience and passion for afforestation and planting, inspiring the audience with his commitment to environmental sustainability. NITK Director, Prof. B. Ravi appreciated Dr. Aparna P., Professor In-charge Horticulture, for her innovative concept of Vrukshavana, which involves creating Miyawaki forest blocks in the name of incoming batches of students.

He quoted recent reports to emphasise that future employment as well as education will be disrupted by AI. However, we need AI tools which are explainable, reliable and ethical, which is possible only by adopting engineering approach for product development. On the other hand, core disciplines need to reinvent themselves by adapting AI tools to remain relevant. To achieve both objectives, core branches and circuit branches need to work closely together. This requires a bold curriculum and novel pedagogy. The first panel discussion, moderated by Prof. Reddy, delved into Curriculum - What to teach . The panellists included Dr. Mervin J.

They recognized that GenZ students are fast and visual learners, tech savvy, and want experiential learning (less teaching, more doing ). While theory is essential for a strong foundation, it must be made interesting by real-life examples and course projects. The curriculum must provide ample choice and co-curricular activities; it must impart critical thinking, collaboration, communication and caring attitude in students.

Each year, our graduating students are presented with a silver ring, etched with the NITK emblem and their year of graduation. This ceremony is special as our faculty members personally present the ring to each student, treating them as esteemed guests and wishing them well for their future endeavors. The ring serves a dual purpose - it symbolically unites the student with their cherished Alma Mater and fosters a sense of unity among KRECians NITKians across the globe. This year s ceremony, held on 28th March 2024, was a grand affair. A total of 2107 Silver rings were presented to all the outgoing students from various programmes including B.Tech, MTech, MCA, MBA, MSc, MTech Research, and PhD. Special recognition was given to the best outgoing students of the year in several categories, who received gold silver medals, student prize funds, and certificates. We were honored to have Shri S.S Nayak, a Chartered Accountant and Senior Partner at M s. S. S. Nayak and Associates, as our Chief Guest. The event was presided over by Prof. B. Ravi, the Director of NITK Surathkal, with Prof. A. C Hegde, Dean of Students Welfare, and Prof. Dwarakesh, Dean Academics, among the dignitaries.

Dr. Jeyaraj s pioneering work in the fields of Dynamics of Heated Structures, Bio-composites, and Acoustics is making a profound impact. One of his notable contributions is addressing the issue of noise pollution - an often overlooked problem that can disrupt the tranquility of auditoriums and meeting halls. Traditional sound absorption materials can be toxic and pose health risks. In response to this challenge, Dr. Jeyaraj and his team have ingeniously developed sound absorption panels made from bio-degradable materials like natural fiber (Areca-husk) and bio-composites. These eco-friendly alternatives not only effectively absorb sound but also ensure safety for human health and the environment.

Prof.Jena s work mainly focuses on system identification and control using data-driven machine learning algorithms, and its application to renewable energy systems. Some of his works are based on analysing the uncertainties that arise from integration of different renewables such as wind and solar generation to large power networks. One of his main areas of research interest is the probabilistic load flow (PLF) of large power networks in the presence of renewable generations. PLF helps to plan and expand the power networks, making them stronger against unexpected events. It also helps to optimize the operation of smart grids, which are an important part of our future energy systems. This recognition is not an individual accomplishment but reflects the dedication and hard work of our entire faculty. Prof. Jena is one among seven faculty members from NITK who have been honored with this prestigious recognition. We will be sharing more about the other five esteemed faculty members in subsequent posts. We extend our heartfelt congratulations to Dr. Jena on this remarkable achievement.",

The first aspect was the tribute to the millions of ordinary citizens who sacrificed their lives in the freedom struggle, how their spirit courage should inspire us to fight for our own goals dreams. Prof. Ravi said Many of them young old, men women, wealthy poor, across the country gave up their studies, careers and families, to fight the British in their own ways, but with a single goal to make India an independent country that decides its own destiny. The second aspect was the need to free ourselves from the chains of poverty, ignorance, disease and disharmony, which are still plaguing many parts of our country. The importance of economic development, education, health and harmony as the means to overcome these challenges was emphasized by Prof. Ravi. He said, Like the struggle for political freedom, these battles also require concerted efforts of all stakeholders. The third aspect was the recognition of India s ancient heritage and legacy as a world leader in terms of knowledge and wealth, how we need to revive that glory by creating a holistic cycle that utilizes knowledge to generate wealth utilizes wealth to create new knowledge. He said, We have been led to believe that knowledge wealth, that is Saraswati and Lakshmi, cannot co-exist. It is time to free ourselves from this wrong mindset. We need to create a holistic cycle that utilizes knowledge to generate wealth utilizes wealth to create new knowledge. In other words, the pursuit of scientific research and practical application are both equally important, especially for technical institutes of national importance, like NIT-K. The fourth aspect was the vision for India s future by 2047, the centenary year of independence, and how each one of us can contribute to making it a happy, healthy prosperous country.

Since we observe the rest of the Universe through light, black holes must be directly unobservable. Theories of stellar evolution predict that black holes of various masses must be everywhere in the Universe. In the last decade, direct evidence of black holes have been found in many ways. Part of this year s Nobel prize in Physics has been awarded for detecting and characterizing the supermassive black hole at the core of our Galaxy (Andrea Ghez and Reinhard Genzel). I will discuss their work, and also present other ways in which black holes are detected. Iwill explore the connection with past, present and future research and opportunities in India, in particular TMT and LIGO-India. Join Here YouTube Live: Google Meet:",
