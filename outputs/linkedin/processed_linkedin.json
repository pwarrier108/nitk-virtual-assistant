After considerable thought and planning, we took a bold step by introducing a new subsidiary to our existing start-up, fully aware of the risks involved. We arrived in Bangalore earlier than planned to better understand the market, diving deep into market and customer insights. This exploration confirmed the potential of our idea, which I ll delve into in a future post. Reflecting on the past three years, it s been a cycle of trying, failing, and persevering. The driving force behind my relentless pursuit, I believe, is the fear of stagnation, often referred to as action bias. While some view this trait positively, I consider it not just beneficial but essential, albeit with its drawbacks. The recent NITKonnect event brought to light the true value of action bias. Faced with a last-minute reduction from a seven-minute pitch to merely two minutes, coupled with technical glitches and slow internet, we were stripped of our prepared presentation. In that moment, the only path forward was to share our story and journey in the most authentic and relatable manner. Without a structured pitch or deck, we relied solely on a brief video and our three-year saga. Ultimately, the essence of an idea is transcended by the resilience and narrative of its journey, which we conveyed, resonating strongly with the audience. This experience underscored a crucial lesson: while action bias may have its pitfalls, its presence is invaluable. Witnessing it unfold and salvage our pitch was a testament to its power. The journey, with all its ups and downs, is what truly resonates and endures. Adding to this, my brief stint in Bangalore dramatically transformed my life in just three days. It revealed both the possibilities and the limitations, offering a vivid perspective on what could and couldn t be. This experience reinforced my belief that one should embrace change and challenges head-on, as they never seem to arrive in any other manner. Bangalore not only changed my view on our start-up s potential but also on personal growth and adaptability. Embracing change and confronting challenges directly is essential, as they invariably come unannounced, shaping us in unforeseen yet profound ways.

As India we have accepted to reach it by 2070. In response, I delved into various ways to enhance efficiency, exploring energy sources from solar wind to electric, hydrogen, fuel cells, and more. However, I found myself acknowledging that without embracing a more minimalistic lifestyle, achieving the net-zero goal seems challenging. In our society s pursuit of a high quality of living, marked by car ownership and numerous gadgets, attaining net zero emissions appears elusive. Even as we utilize to optimize consumption, the growing demand for a comfortable lifestyle raises doubts about our ability to reach this ambitious target. I encountered an interesting app suggesting routes based on minimal energy consumption, but I pondered whether a truly net-zero carbon route is feasible. As a technology enthusiast, I questioned the allocation of valuable energy resources for computations that might not ultimately save an equivalent amount of energy. The finite nature of Earth s resources challenges the idea of unlimited technological progress. While these are complex issues that demand attention, there are practical steps we can take as individuals to contribute to the net-zero goal: Local Dining and Shopping: Opt for local dining and groceries, reducing the need for energy-intensive food delivery and excess packaging. E-commerce Practices: Choose local stores for online purchases to minimize the environmental impact of long-distance logistics. Energy-Efficient Living: Embrace better-ventilated homes without excessive reliance on air conditioners, considering their significant energy consumption. Solar Water Heaters: Install solar geysers to significantly reduce the electricity consumption associated with traditional electric geysers, especially in low-rise apartment buildings. Let s adopt these simple changes in our lives to ensure a sustainable planet for future generations. Together, we can make a difference.",
